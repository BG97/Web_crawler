KeywordsCaprifig                Ficus carica              FigMicrosatellitesMoraceaeSSRsTunisiaBackgroundThe common fig (Ficus carica L.; 2n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2x<U+2009>=<U+2009>26) [1] belongs to the Moraceae, a family with over 1400 species distributed in about 40 genera. The genus Ficus L. contains about 750 species of woody trees, epiphytes and shrubs, mainly of tropical and subtropical distribution, divided into six subgenera [2, 3] that share a unique inflorescence, the syconium. Common fig seems to be originated from Southern Arabia and the eastern part of the Mediterranean regions and, together with the grapevine and the olive, is considered one of the three classical fruit trees associated with the beginning of horticulture in the Mediterranean Basin [4–6] domesticated at a very early stage contemporarily with cereal crops [7].                        Ficus carica L. is a gynodioecious species with two sexual forms: male trees (caprifigs) that produce syconia with separate male and female flowers and female trees that produce syconia with only female flowers that will develop into edible seeded figs if pollinated. Since only male trees produce pollen the common fig is functionally a dioecious species. Three types of female figs are cultivated [8]: the common-type that develops fruit parthenocarpically without pollination and can produce one (unifera varieties) or two (bifera varieties) crops, the Smyrna-type that requires pollination with pollen from caprifigs, and the San Pedro-type that produces a first crop parthenocarpically (breba) and a second crop (fig) only after pollination with pollen from caprifigs. Pollination in the genus Ficus is dependent on the coevolution of Ficus species with pollinating wasps of the family Agaonidae [9]. In the case of the common fig, pollination (caprification) is performed by a specific pollinating insect, Blastophaga psenes L. The caprifigs produce fruits in three crop cycles during each growing season, each harboring the larvae, pupae and, temporarily, the adults of the pollinating Blastophaga [8]: “profichi” that ripen in early summer, “mammoni” that ripen in autumn and “mamme” that overwinter on the tree and mature in spring. Only the \"profichi” carry pollen and are used for pollination. Pollination occurs naturally when female and caprifig trees are present in the same orchard or when caprifig branches with flowers are placed close to female fig trees. The main problems of caprification in Tunisia, which are common to other fig producing areas, are the disruption of the cycle of Blastophaga psenes in cold mountainous areas and the unavailability of mature caprifig “profichi” when female figs are receptive.In Tunisia, as in other Mediterranean countries [10], fig has been traditionally cultivated since ancient times in diverse edaphoclimatic conditions, in association with date palms in the south or olive trees in other regions of the country resulting in a high number of local varieties and frequent exchange of varieties among different regions [11, 12]. The denominations of the cultivars are usually based on the color, size and time of fruit ripening or geographical origin resulting in confusion in nomenclature. Hence, appropriate characterization and differentiation among cultivars is necessary to optimize fig germplasm management and conservation, jeopardized by intensive urbanization, cultivation of selected clonal varieties or biotic and abiotic stresses. This genetic erosion is even more important in caprifigs since they do not produce edible fruits and, consequently, the pressure to conserve genetic resources is lower. However, artificial caprification is still a common practice in Tunisian fig cultivation and, consequently, caprifigs are used by farmers in order to obtain edible fig production [12].Various studies have reported the use of morphological traits [11–19] and isozyme markers [20, 21] for fig characterization. However, these parameters are influenced by environmental conditions and the phenological status of the trees. To overcome these difficulties, different molecular tools such as RAPDs [13, 20–27] ISSRs [6, 19, 24, 26–28], AFLPs [20, 29, 30], RFLPs [6] or SSRs [6, 10, 26, 27, 30–41] have been used for fig germplasm characterization and diversity analyses. However, most of those studies include mainly female fig cultivars and molecular characterization and diversity studies in caprifigs are very scarce.The main objective of this study was to characterize and evaluate the genetic diversity of 20 Tunisian caprifig accessions using SSR markers in order to develop strategies to preserve the endangered genetic resources of this species.MethodsPlant material                This study was carried out on 20 Tunisian caprifig accessions originated in different geographic regions and with different phenotypic traits (Table 1 and Fig. 1). All the accessions were planted in the fig germplasm collection of the Arid Land Institute of Médenine established in El Gordhab, Tataouine in Southeastern Tunisia. The plant material was propagated by hardwood cuttings.Table 1                        Names and localities of origin of the 20 Tunisian caprifig accessions studied in this work                      No.Accession nameLocality of origin (Governorate)Syconia shapeExternal syconia colorInternal syconia colorNumber of leaf lobes1Magouli1Douiret (Tataouine)GloboseLight greenLight pinkThree2JraniGhadhabna (Mahdia)GlobosePurple greenLight yellowThree3Bithri1Kerkennah (Sfax)OblongPurple greenLight yellowFive4AssafriKerkennah (Sfax)OblongPurple greenLight yellowThree5Bouharrag1Bir Amir (Tataouine)GloboseLight greenDark pinkFive6Bithri2Bir Amir (Tataouine)OblongLight greenLight pinkThree7Dhokkar1Djebba (Béja)OblongLight greenLight yellowThree8LimiKébéli (KébéliOblongGreenDark pinkThree9TebessiKébéli (Kébéli)OblongGreenDark pinkFive10SawoudiKébéli (Kébéli)OblongPurple greenLight pinkFive11Magouli2Bir Amir (Tataouine)OblongLight greenLight pinkFive12Dhokkar2Tamaghza (Tozeur)OblongPurple greenLight yellowOne13Dhokkar3Dégâche (Tozeur)OblongPurple greenLight yellowFive14Dhokkar4GafsaOblongDark purpleLight yellowThree15Bouharrag2Toujen (Gabés)GloboseLight greenDark pinkOne16BeldiZarzis (Médenine)OblongPurple greenLight yellowFive17Dhokkar6Zarzis (Médenine)OblongPurple greenLight pinkThree18Dhokkar7Zammour (Médenine)OblongPurple greenLight yellowThree19Bouharrag3Djerba (Médenine)GloboseDark greenDark pinkFive20KhadhouriDjerba (Médenine)GloboseGreenDark pinkThree                                          Fig. 1                        Map showing the geographic localization of the different Tunisian caprifig accessions studied in this work                                    Genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification                Genomic DNA was extracted from lyophilized young leaves following a CTAB-based method optimized previously for fig [33]. After purification, DNA quantity and quality were checked using a Nanodrop ND-1000 UV-visible spectrophotometer, diluted to 10 ng µl-1 with modified TE buffer (1 M Tris–HCl pH 8.0; 0.5 M EDTA) and used for PCR amplification.                A set of 13 SSR loci (MFC1, MFC2, MFAC4, LMFC15, LMFC18, LMFC21, LMFC23, LMFC24, LMFC27, LMFC28, LMFC30, LMFC31 and LMFC32), previously developed in fig [31, 33] were used in 15 µl reactions containing 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 67 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01 % Tween 20, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM each dNTP, 0.4 µM each primer, 25 ng genomic DNA and 0.5 Units of BioTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK). Amplifications were performed in a thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following temperature profile: an initial step of 1 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final step of 5 min at 72 °C. The amplification products were resolved using a CEQTM 2000XL capillary DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).              Data analysis                Different parameters of genetic diversity were estimated: number of alleles per locus (A), allelic frequencies, observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), Wright’s fixation index and probability of identity (PI). Those parameters were only computed using the SSRs that produced amplification of a single locus (e.g. one or two alleles amplified in each of the samples analyzed). The computations were performed with the program POPGENE 1.32 [42] and IDENTITY 1.0 [43]. Genetic relationships within the accessions studied were calculated using UPGMA cluster analysis of the similarity matrix obtained from the proportion of shared amplification fragments [44] using the program NTSYS 2.11 (Exeter Software, Stauket, NY). The cophenetic correlation coefficient was estimated by comparing with the Mantel test the cophenetic matrix obtained from the dendrogram with the original similarity matrix. The bootstrap values were obtained using 2000 replicates with TREECON 1.3b [45]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using NTSYS 2.11(Exeter Software, Stauket, NY).              Results and discussionGenetic polymorphism and SSR patterns                The 13 SSR loci produced successful and repeatable amplification fragments in all the 20 caprifig accessions analyzed, resulting in a total of 37 alleles ranging from two (LMFC32, LMFC15, LMFC21, LMFC31, LMFC18, LMFC27 and LMFC23) to six (LMFC30) alleles per locus (Table 2), with an average of 2.85 alleles per locus and amplification fragment sizes between 120 and 278 bp. Some accessions showed the amplification of more than two alleles (three alleles in LMFC30, MFC1, MFC4 and four alleles in LMFC28) suggesting the probable amplification of more than one locus. Similar results for those 4 loci were obtained by Giraldo et al. [35] analyzing an ex situ germplasm collection of 209 fig accessions. The remaining 9 SSRs showed one or two bands per genotype, suggesting the amplification of a single locus. For these 9 loci, the accessions studied were considered homozygous or heterozygous when one or two fragments were present per locus respectively [46]. Genetic diversity was studied with the 9 loci that produced one or two alleles per locus. For these loci, allelic frequencies varied from 0.03 to 0.98 with a mean of 0.45 (data not shown). Furthermore, 15 % of the alleles studied were considered rare (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and fixed (p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.9). Additionally, six alleles were found only in one accession (allele 205 of LMFC32 is present only in ‘Jrani’; allele 278 of LMFC24 is present only in ‘Dhokkar2’; allele 271 of LMFC21 is present only in ‘Dhokkar3’; allele 256 of LMFC30 is present only in ‘Dhokkar1’ and allele 193 of LMFC 28 is present in ‘Bouharrag2’).Table 2                        Locus name, range size, allele number (A), observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity, probability of identity (PI) and fixation index calculated for 20 Tunisian caprifig accessions                      LocusSize (bp)AHoHePIFLMFC15205–20720.500.420.60-0.19LMFC18120–12620.250.220.68-0.14LMFC21265–27220.050.050.91-0.03LMFC23132–13420.100.100.83-0.05LMFC24274–27830.250.450.550.45LMFC27186–19620.550.400.60-0.38LMFC28183–2005    LMFC30231–2586    LMFC31228–24220.800.500.62-0.62LMFC32205–20920.050.050.91-0.03MFC1176–1923    MFC2157–17030.400.430.450.08MFC4198–2213    Mean  0.330.290.68-0.10                Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.05 (LMFC32 and LMFC21) to 0.80 (LMFC31) with a mean of 0.33 (Table 2). The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.05 (LMFC32 and LMFC21) to 0.50 (LMFC31) with a mean of 0.29 (Table 2). A heterozygote excess (Hobs<U+2009>><U+2009>Hexp) was observed for the LMFC15, LMFC31, LMFC18, LMFC27 loci whereas a deficit of heterozygosity (Hobs<U+2009><<U+2009>Hexp) was observed in LMFC24 and MFC2 loci (Table 2). For the loci LMFC 32, LMFC21 and LMFC23 observed and expected heterozygosities were similar (Table 2). The maximum value of the probability of identity (0.91) was detected in LMFC32 and LMFC21 and the minimum (0.45) in MFC2 (Table 2).                The diversity parameters obtained in this work are mostly below the range of those reported for fig using microsatellites in previous works that mainly analyzed female cultivars [6, 10, 26, 27, 30, 41]. Although most of those works included the analysis of a higher number of female genotypes from different origins, the results obtained suggest a low genetic diversity in the Tunisian caprifig accessions studied (see below).              Cluster and principal component analysesAmong all the possible UPGMA dendrograms generated, that with the highest cophenetic correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.76) between the cophenetic coefficient and the similarity matrix was chosen. The UPGMA dendrogram obtained showed three main groups among the genotypes analyzed (Fig. 2) with three undistinguishable accessions that represent a case of synonymy (Assafri from Kerkennah, Beldi and Dhokkar6 from Zarzis). The first group (A) includes 7 accessions (Magouli1, Bouharrag1, Khadhouri, Magouli2, Dhokkar4, Bithri2 and Bouharrag2), the second (B) contains 10 accessions (Jrani, Dhokkar7, Dhokkar1, Assafri, Beldi, Dhokkar6, Bouharrag3, Bithri1, Dhokkar3 and Dhokkar2) and the third (C) includes 3 accessions (Limi, Sawoudi and Tebessi). Several homonymies were detected in the genotypes analyzed since genotypes having the same name in the same or different locations are genetically different. This includes all the different samples analyzed of Magouli (2 samples), Bouharrag (3 samples), Bithri (2 samples) and Dhokkar (6 samples). Among all the nodes obtained only three groups have bootstrap values higher than 50 %. These groups include the three undistinguishable accessions (Assafri, Beldi and Dhokkar6) (bootstrap of 95 %), those three accessions and Bouharrag3 (bootstrap of 71 %) and the accessions Limi and Sawoudi (bootstrap of 62 %).Principal Component Analysis shows that the three first principal components explain 50.50 % of the total variability. The contributions of PCA1, PCA2 and PCA3 were 21.33, 19.26 and 9.92 % respectively. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of accessions according to the first two components (PCA1 and PCA 2) in which three groups that correspond to those found in the UPGMA analysis can be clearly identified.Some of the main groups obtained in the UPGMA and PCA studies are correlated with the geographic origin of the genotypes. Thus the group C in Figs. 2 and 3 corresponds to three cultivars (Limi, Tebessi and Sawoudi) from the same location in Southwestern Tunisia (Kébéli) and the group of three undistinguishable cultivars (Assafri, Beldi and Dhokkar6), which are probable synonymies, were originated in Eastern Tunisia. Six of the accessions, even from different geographic origins, wear the name ‘Dhokkar’; although this could be a case of homonymy, it has to be considered that ‘dhokkar’ is the common word for caprifig in Arabic. Regarding the rest of the accessions analyzed, although some of the ones that cluster together (such as Dhokkar2 and Dhokkar3) have a common geographical origin, no clear geographical groupings can be found for most of them. Similar results have also been obtained with common type figs in Tunisia using different types of molecular markers [24, 28] These results could suggest a common genetic base for most Tunisian caprifigs that can be explained by the easy vegetative propagation of the crop that allows exchange of plant material between different regions. This contrasts with a higher genetic diversity found in Tunisian common figs by characterizing cultivated and wild figs [41].

The set of SSR markers used indicates that the genetic diversity between accessions studied is overall narrow and that no clear relationship is found between geographical origin and genetic composition suggesting exchange of caprifig genetic material among different regions. Additional studies with caprifigs from other countries should be performed in order to have a clear picture on overall caprifig genetic diversity and optimize collaborative caprifig genetic resource management and conservation.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsFinancial support for this work was provided by the Tunisian Education Ministry, the University of Monastir and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation (Project Grant AGL2013-43732-R).

KeywordsGenetic variationLinkage disequilibrium                        Panicum virgatum LPopulation structureBackgroundGenetic diverstiy is a significant factor that contributes to crop improvement. Evaluation of genetic variation in contemporary germplasm through breeding programs may be indirectly favorable for genetic progress in future cultivars [1]. Thus, estimation of plant diversity is crucial for the efficacious use of genetic resources in breeding programs. Molecular markers, as particular segments of DNA that represent different functional classes, play an essential role in all aspects of plant breeding, and have been widely used to estimate genetic variation.Compared with conventional phenotyping methods, molecular markers have numerous advantages as they are easily detectable and stable in plant tissues regardless of environmental influences [2]. The inter simple sequence repeat marker (ISSR) is highly polymorphic and is useful in studies of genetic diversity, genome mapping and evolutionary biology [3]. This PCR-based technique is used in various types of plants and can overcome many defects of other marker methods, such as high-cost of amplified fragment length (AFLP) and the low reproducibility of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [4]. Start codon targeted marker (SCoT) is a reliable and simple gene-targeted marker located on the translational start codon [5]. This technique involves designing single primers from the short conserved region flanking the ATG start codon [6] without knowing any further genomic sequence information. It has been used in peanut and mango crops for genetic diversity and cultivar relationship analysis [7]. Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats marker (EST-SSR) detects variation based on the expressed portion of the genome from EST databases, thus explaining the low cost of development compared with the genomic simple sequence repeat marker (SSR) [8]. These EST-SSR primers can be used across various species for comparative mapping and the construction of genetic linkage maps [9, 10]. Each marker type has unique advantages and these three marker systems have found extensive application in the evaluation of genetic variation, population structure, and assisted selection for crop improvement [3, 11â<U+0080><U+0093>14]. Many studies have shown that these markers are mainly used to develop genetic linkage maps [15, 16], however, fewer studies have focused on constructing linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps. Remarkably, LD and linkage are two different genetic terms, where LD refers to correlation between alleles in a population, while LD means the correlated inheritance of loci through physical connection on a chromosome [17]. Some factors can affect the LD level, including allele frequency and recombination. Unlike linkage analysis, LD mapping relies on a natural population which is used to identify the relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation. LD mapping, that is association analysis, represents a useful tool to identify trait-marker relationships, and the first LD mapping of a quantitative trait was the analysis of flowering time and the dwarf8 gene in maize [18].Linkage disequilibrium (LD), referring to the nonrandom association of alleles between linked or unlinked loci, is the basis of association mapping to identify genetic regions associated with agronomic traits [17]. Recently, LD studies have been performed in various plants, such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) [19], barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) [20], Maize (Zea mays L.) [21], chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) [22], perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) [23], and the model legume, Medicago truncatula [24]. The level of LD is constantly regarded as a standard to reflect mapping resolution. Association mapping in populations with low LD requires a high number of markers, whereas a high LD means low mapping resolution [25]. In addition, information about population structure within germplasm collections is also crucial for the interpretation and identification of associations between genetic and functional diversity, and to assess whether the inter-sample relatedness is suitable for association studies [26â<U+0080><U+0093>28]. Therefore, population structure is also included as an effect in models used for association analysis. [15, 29].Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), as a warm season C4 perennial grass that is native to North America [30], is regarded as an important biofuel crop for its remarkable biomass yield and good adaptability on marginal lands thereby not competing with food crops on farmland [31â<U+0080><U+0093>33]. In this study, we explored two distinct forms of switchgrass, upland and lowland ecotypes. The upland accessions are distributed in northern cold areas with lower biomass than lowland varieties. Generally, upland switchgrass is shorter (â<U+0089>¤2.4 m, tall) than lowland types (â<U+0089>¥ 2.7 m) in favorable environments. However, lowland cultivars appear more sensitive to moisture stress than upland cultivars [34].Constructing association maps comparing the physiological and genetic basis of varying stresses can provide an available reference for the genetic improvement of switchgrass, and the evaluation of the level of LD and population structure can aid association analyses. To date, however, LD analysis across the switchgrass genome remains inadequate [35]. In our study, we present 134 switchgrass accessions supplied by Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit, Griffin, Georgia USA to identify the levels of genetic variation, population structure, and extent of LD using 51 markers including 16 ISSRs, 20 SCoTs, and 15 EST-SSRs. These results will provide a valuable molecular basis for enriching switchgrass genetic variation, and the information on the level of LD and population structure may guide association mapping using this representative collection.Here we constructed a three-marker molecular dataset with important applications for diversity analysis, establishment of population structure and evaluation of linkage disequilibrium in switchgrass which is an allogamous species.Results and discussionGenetic variation analysis                The ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR primers were screened using the selected four genotypes [PI421999 (AM-314/MS-155), PI422006 (Alamo), PI642190 (Falcon), and PI642207 (70SG 016)]. After the initial screening, the numbers of selected ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR primers used in further studies were reduced to 16, 20, and 15 pairs, respectively (Table 1).Table 1                        The ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR primers used in this study and amplification results                      PrimerPrimer sequence (5â<U+0080>²â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0086><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>3â<U+0080>²)Annealing (Â°C)Total number of amplified bands (TNB)The number of polymorphic bands (NPB)Percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) %)ISSR-UBC812(GA)8A52.0131292.31ISSR-UBC827(AC)8G53.01010100.00ISSR-UBC828(TG)8A52.09888.89ISSR-UBC829(TG)8C52.0121083.33ISSR-UBC830(TG)8G55.0141392.86ISSR-UBC835(AG)8YC52.0151386.67ISSR-UBC836(AG)8YT54.0171482.35ISSR-UBC844(CT)8RC52.0141285.71ISSR-UBC848(CA)8RG53.0141392.86ISSR-UBC854(TC)8RG52.01515100.00ISSR-UBC868(GAA)655.0131292.31ISSR-UBC876(GATA)2(GACA)252.0161381.25ISSR-UBC879(CTTCA)353.0171482.35ISSR-UBC887DVD(TC)752.01414100.00ISSR-UBC890VHV(GT)752.0131184.62ISSR-UBC891HVH(TG)752.0141285.71SCoT2CAACAATGGCTACCACCC55.0171482.35SCoT3CAACAATGGCTACCACCG55.0343191.18SCoT4CAACAATGGCTACCACCT55.0211990.48SCoT5CAACAATGGCTACCACGA55.0211990.48SCoT6CAACAATGGCTACCACGC55.0222091.91SCoT7CAACAATGGCTACCACGG55.0222091.91SCoT9CAACAATGGCTACCAGCA55.0201995.00SCoT10CAACAATGGCTACCAGCC55.0212095.00SCoT12ACGACATGGCGACCAACG55.0252496.00SCoT13ACGACATGGCGACCATCG55.0252288.00SCoT15ACGACATGGCGACCGCGA55.0181688.89SCoT16ACCATGGCTACCACCGAC55.0262492.31SCoT18ACCATGGCTACCACCGCC55.0201890.00SCoT21ACGACATGGCGACCCACA55.0211990.48SCoT28CCATGGCTACCACCGCCA55.0252288.00SCoT31CCATGGCTACCACCGCCT55.0221986.36SCoT34ACCATGGCTACCACCGCA55.0211990.48SCoT35CATGGCTACCACCGGCCC55.0211990.48SCoT37CAATGGCTACCACTAGCC55.0232086.96SCoT48ACAATGGCTACCACTGGC55.0201890.00EST-SSR-cnl35f: AAGTGAGCACAACGACACGA58.09888.89r:CGATCCAAAGAAGCAAAGATGEST-SSR-cnl37f:CTGCCTCGCGTGAAAGATA59.010990.00r:CCTCCTCGATCTGGATGGTEST-SSR-cnl42f:GTTGGTCTGCTGCTCACTCG59.09888.89r:CCGACGATGTTGAAGGAGAGEST-SSR-cnl47f: GACTCGCACGATTTCTCCTC57.09888.89r:GCCAGACAACCAATTCAGGTEST-SSR-cnl51f:CTAGGGTTTCCCACCTCTCA59.08675.00r:AATGTCCTTGGCGTTGCTEST-SSR-cnl55f:GCTGATAGCGAGGTGGGTAG58.0141178.57r:CTGCCGGTTGATCTTGTTCTEST-SSR-cnl61f:CACGAGTGCAGAGCTAGACG60.05480.00r:ACAACAACCCGACTGCTACCEST-SSR-cnl86f:CAACAACGTCAACGCCTTC59.011872.73r:GCGTCTTGAACCTCTTGTCCEST-SSR-cnl100f:CGTCGTCCTCTGCTGTGAG58.05480.00r:AGGTCGTCCATCTGCTGCTEST-SSR-cnl115f:CGAGAAGAAGGTGGTGTCGT59.07685.71r:AGGTCGTGGAAGGTCTTGGEST-SSR-cnl119f:ATCGTCTCCTCCTCCTCCA57.066100.00r:ATGCCTCGGTGGACTGGTAEST-SSR-cnl130f:AAATGTTGAGCAACGGGAGCT59.07685.71r:ACTTCATAGGGCGGAGGTCTEST-SSR-cnl144f:AGAAGGCGGCTCAGAAGAAG58.01010100.00r:GCTCCAACTCAGAATCAACAAEST-SSR-cnl147f:GGCTAGGGTTTCGACTCCTC60.09777.78r:AGATGGCGAACTCGACCTGEST-SSR-cnl158f:CTCATCCCACCACCACCAC59.099100.00r:CCCTGAAGAAGTCGAACACGTotal  79370889.28                These three marker systems (ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR) have been used for cultivar identification and genetic variation assessment in many plant species [36â<U+0080><U+0093>39]. In this study, these markers were successfully used to differentiate switchgrass accessions. A total of 51 primer pairs were used and 793 bands were produced, with a mean of 15.5 bands per primer, among which 89.28 % were polymorphic. Our results suggested that ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR analyses could contribute to the detection of genetic variation. In addition, Neiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s (1973) gene diversity index (H) and Shannonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s information index (I) was 0.311 and 0.471, respectively, and the similarity coefficient, ranging from 0.162 to 0.857 with an average of 0.510 was similar to other studies on switchgrass, in which the similarity coefficients were estimated to be between 0.45 to 0.81 [40] or 0.53 to 0.78 [41]. This indicates that switchgrass has abundant genetic variation and is a highly heterogenous species [42]. The AMOVA of the distance matrix for the genotypes permitted a partitioning of the overall variation into two levels: between upland and lowland ecotypes and within a population. The results revealed genetic differentiation between upland and lowland ecotypes (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001), with 31.42 % of genetic variation between ecotypes and 68.58 % of genetic variation within ecotypes. Similar results were obtained in other switchgrass germplasm collections [40, 43, 44] and in other perennial, and cross-pollinated plants [45].              Marker efficiency analysis                In this study, we extracted genomic DNA from an individual so that we were able to obtain complete genetic information including allele numbers, gene frequency and observed heterozygosity for marker efficiency analysis. A parameter marker index (MI) was used to compare the efficiencies of the three assays in the collection of 134 switchgrass genotypes (Table 2). There was almost no disparity between the average band informativeness (Ibav) indice for ISSRs, SCoTs, and EST-SSRs, which were 0.38, 0.43, and 0.36, respectively. However, the effective multiplex ratio (EMR) index for ScoT (20.10) was twice as high as that of the ISSRs (12.25) and three times as high as that of the EST-SSRs (7.33). The MI calculation indicated an efficient and distinctive nature of the SCoTs with the MI for these markers (8.64) higher than the other two assays examined here (4.66 for ISSRs and 2.64 for EST-SSRs).Table 2                        Comparison of usefulness between ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR markers for 134 switchgrass accessions                      ItemsISSRSCoTEST-SSRNo. of primers162015No. of total bands220445128No. of average bands per primers13.7522.258.53Percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB)0.890.900.86Average band informativeness (Ibav)0.380.430.36Effective multiplex ratio (EMR)12.2520.107.33Marker index (MI)4.668.642.64                A parameter MI, has been widely used to evaluate the overall utility of each marker system [46]. The high MI in the SCoTs results from its high EMR, making these markers appropriate for fingerprinting [47] or evaluating genetic variation in breeding populations [48, 49]. In addition, the SCoTs performed well in other species. Compared with ISSR and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP), SCoT markers were more informative than IRAP and ISSR for the assessment of diversity among Persian oak (Quercus brantii Lindl.) individuals [50]. Results from the evaluation on the genetic variation of mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivars indicated that the SCoT analysis represents actual relationships better than the ISSR analysis [51].              Population structure analysis                After removing low frequency bands (considering MAFâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¤â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05), we analyzed the data from 51 pairs of ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR primers to understand the population structure of the entire switchgrass collection based on a Bayesian clustering approach using STRUCTURE [52]. The number of subpopulations (K) was identified based on maximum likelihood and Î<U+0094>K values. For the 134 switchgrass genotypes the maximum Î<U+0094>K was observed at Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2 (Fig. 1), with genotypes falling into two subpopulations. Using a membership probability threshold of 0.75, 76 genotypes were assigned to subpopulation 1 (G1), out of which, 69 genotypes belonged to upland ecotypes, and the remaining 7 were lowland. Subpopulation 2 (G2) contained 42 genotypes, and all of them were upland ecotypes. The remaining 16 genotypes were classified into an admixed group as they had membership probabilities lower than 0.75 in any given subpopulation. With the maximum membership probability, 91 accessions were assigned to G1 and 43 accessions to G2 (Fig. 2).                                          Fig. 1                        STRUCTURE analysis of the number of populations for K. The number of subpopulations (K) was identified based on maximum likelihood and Î<U+0094>K values. The most likely value of K identified by STRUCTURE was observed at Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2                                                                Fig. 2                        Two subgroups inferred from STRUCTURE analysis. The vertical coordinate of each subgroup means the membership coefficients for each accessions; the digits of the horizontal coordinate represent the 134 switchgrass accessions corresponding to Table 3; Red zone: G1, Green zone: G2                                      The UPGMA cluster analysis from 51 markers generated a dendrogram, demonstrating that the 134 genotypes could be clearly divided into two groups (Fig. 3). The dendrogram clustered all of the lowland ecotypes (LL) into the first. The second group contained all of the upland ecotypes (UL). Other methods have also been used to cluster upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes. Missaoui et al adopted restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers to analyze the genetic relationships among 21 switchgrass genotypes, resulting in three upland and eighteen lowland genotypes clusteringinto two different groups [53]. Huang et al identified differences between the coding sequences of a nuclear gene encoding plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase in upland and lowland ecotypes genetic variation analysis at gene level, provided by Huang et al researching about a nuclear gene encoding plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase [54]. In this study, we preliminarily presented population structure analysis of 7 lowland and 127 upland genotypes using 51 ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR primer pairs, resulting in an apparently separate cluster among the two ecotypes, confirming the genetic differences between upland and lowland ecotypes. However, as we do not have as many lowland switchgrass samples as upland, we highly recommend more lowland ecotype or other nuclear markers should be used in conjunction with ISSR, SCoT and EST-SSR to more appropriately classify upland and lowland ecotypes.                                          Fig. 3                        Radiation of genetic relationships for 134 switchgrass accessions based on UPGMA. G1 and G2 are the two subgroups identified by STRUCTURE with the maximum membership probability. The numbers at the branches are confidence values based on Felsensteinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bootstrap produced by FreeTree software, as a general rule, the higher bootstrap value for a given interior branch indicates a closer relationship                                      Based on modified Rogers distances (MRD), PCA separated the 134 genotypes into two major groups, which was consistent with assignments generated by STRUCTURE and the UPGMA dendrogram (Fig. 4). Seven genotypes formed group 1 (Fig. 4, upper right), and the other 127 genotypes, belonging to group 2, were mainly distributed at the lower portion of the plot. The accessions belonging to G1 inferred by the STRUCTURE analysis were all distributed on the right portion of the resulting plot, while G2 was distributed on the left portion of the plot. The distribution of G1 accessions was less tightly clustered than G2, indicating accessions in G1 had higher diversity than G2 (Fig. 4).                                          Fig. 4                        Principal coordinate analysis of 134 switchgrass accessions based on ISSRs, SCoTs, and EST-SSRs. G1 and G2 are the two subgroups identified by STRUCTURE with the maximum membership probability                                      Before analyzing LD and association mapping, the analysis of population structure emphasizes the need for the genetic analysis of different ecotypes [28]. The UPGMA cluster and PCA analysis demonstrated that 134 genotypes could be clearly divided into two groups (Figs. 1 and 4), and the lowland and upland germplasm clusters were almost completely separated, which was consistent with the results of several other switchgrass studies [41, 55, 56]. For the UPGMA cluster analysis, the first group only included lowland ecotypes, while the second group contained upland ecotypes and could be further classified into two subgroups. Subgroup 1 (G1) contained 83 genotypes, while the remaining 43 belonged to subgroup 2 (G2). The 46 accessions of the 70SG series and 42 accessions of the 71SG series dispersed into these two subgroups are from the same geographical distribution of North Dakota, United States. This indicates that most of the germplasm sub-clustered in accordance with different regions [43, 55], and the assignment of 132 accessions (98.51 % of the total) by the UPGMA cluster analysis was consistent with their classification using PCA (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, in the STRUCTURE analysis, the 127 upland genotypes were assigned to two subpopulations, possibly because the UPGMA and STRUCTURE programs calculate parameters in different ways. Clusters are generated in STRUCTURE based on both transitory Hardyâ<U+0080><U+0093>Weinberg disequilibrium and LD caused by admixture between populations [55], while the UPGMA dendrogram generates clusters based on the genetic distance among populations [57].              Linkage disequilibrium estimation                After the deletion of low frequency alleles (MAFâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¤â<U+0080><U+0089>5 %), the 51 ISSRs, SCoTs, and EST-SSRs with unknown chromosome information were used to evaluate the extent of LD among the switchgrass samples. In the collection, interallelic r2 values, the association between any pair of alleles from different loci, were calculated and ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 with an average r2 of 0.035. Across all 51 loci, 247,456 locus pairs were detected in the 134 switchgrass samples. Among all of the locus pairs, 7107 of 135,718 (5.24 %) showed LD at the Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001 level for G1 and 5415 locus pairs (3.99 %) were found at r2â<U+0080><U+0089>>â<U+0080><U+0089>0.1 at Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001. For G2, 84,154 locus pairs were detected, 4833 were significant pairs (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001, 5.74 %), while 4235 locus pairs (5.03 % of 84,154) were found at r2â<U+0080><U+0089>>â<U+0080><U+0089>0.1 at Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001. The mean r2 for all materials was 0.480 (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001), and the LD in G2 (0.668, ranging from 0.068 to 1.000) was significantly (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001) larger than that in G1 (0.291, ranging from 0.066 to 1.000) (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01).                Populations with high levels of outcrossing have relatively low LD [58]. Among outcrossing maize (Zea mays L.), Remington et al. [59] found lower levels of LD among 47 SSR loci (9.7 % of SSR pairs performing LD at Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01), compared to LD data from an SSR survey of inbred lines of maize, which showed high levels of LD [60]. For switchgrass, LD data comparisons showed a trend towards higher LD in G2 (mean r2â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.668) including 42 genotypes all belonging to upland ecotypes, compared with G1 (mean r2â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.291), which contained 76 genotypes, including 7 lowland ecotypes.              MethodPlant material                A total of 134 switchgrass genotypes, representing most of the natural geographical distribution areas of switchgrass supplied by the Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit, Griffin, Georgia USA were used in this study. These included 7 lowland genotypes originating from 5 US states and 127 upland genotypes originating from Belgium and 15 US states (Table 3). The full accession data and information on switchgrass germplasm comes from ARS GRIN (http://www.ars-grin.gov/). The 134 genotypes, including one seedling from each accession, were grown and maintained in the experimental farm of the Sichuan Agricultural University during the 2012 growing season.Table 3

ecotype switchgrass                                  DNA extraction and marker genotyping                Genomic DNA was extracted from tender leaves of each individual using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [61]. ISSR [designed by the University of British Columbia (UBC set No. 9)], EST-SSR [62], and SCoT primer [45] sequences were aligned to the Panicum reference genome using the bl2seq blast program in NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), which was designed to eliminate redundancies. Initially, four germplasms were used to screen marker primers [PI421999 (AM-314/MS-155), PI422006 (Alamo), PI642190 (Falcon), and PI642207 (70SG 016)]. The selected primers were synthesized by the Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Service Company (Shanghai, China) to genotype the collection.                ISSR-PCR was carried out according to Li et al [63] as follows: the total reaction volume was 15 Î¼L and contained 20 ng template DNA, approximately 1.0 Î¼M primer, 7.5 Î¼L Mix (10â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>PCR buffer, Mg2+, dNTPs; Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), and 1 U Taq polymerase. Amplifications were performed in a BioRad iCycle PCR machine (BIO-RAD Certified) under the following conditions: 95 Â°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of the following: 95 Â°C for 45 s, 52â<U+0080><U+0093>55 Â°C for 45 s, and 72 Â°C for 90 s. A final extension was conducted at 72 Â°C for 7 min. All PCR bands were visualized on 1 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>TBE buffer. Silver staining was used to visualize the bands. The SCoT-PCR amplification reaction was conducted in a total volume of 15 Î¼L according to Collard and Mackill [5], and containing 10 ng template DNA, 0.8 mM primers, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM dNTPs, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). PCR amplification had an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 Â°C, followed by 45 s at 95 Â°C, 45 s at 55 Â°C, 1.5 min at 72 Â°C for 30 cycles, and 7 min at 72 Â°C. PCR products were visualized following agarose gel (1.5 %) electrophoresis at 120Vfor 1.5 h in 1â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>TBE buffer, followed by staining with GelRed (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The EST-SSR PCR consisted of a denaturation for 5 min at 94 Â°C then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 Â°C, 30 s at 53â<U+0080><U+0093>55 Â°C, and 2 min at 72 Â°C, with a final extension of 5 min at 72 Â°C [62] and products were visualized as described above.              Genetic variation and marker efficiency analysis                For each marker, polymorphic alleles were scored as â<U+0080><U+009C>1â<U+0080> for presence and â<U+0080><U+009C>0â<U+0080> for absence at the same mobility, and this data was used to construct an original data matrix. Using Excel 2007 and POPGENE v.1.32 [64], corresponding diversity parameters were estimated including: total number of bands (TNB), number of polymorphic bands (NPB), percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB), Neiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s (1973) gene diversity index (H), and Shannonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s information index (I). AMOVA v.1.55 was employed to reveal genetic variation among groups and within a population [65]. The data input to POPGENE and AMOVA was produced by DCFA v.1.1 [66].                The comparative efficiency of ISSRs, SCoTs, and EST-SSRs in these 134 switchgrass genotypes was assessed with MI. MI is the product of the EMR and the Ibav for the polymorphic markers [67]. EMR is explained as the average number of polymorphic bands [68]. Ibav is defined as:$$ {\mathrm{Ib}}_{\mathrm{av}}=1/n{\displaystyle \sum }1-\left(2\mid 0.5-\mathrm{pi}\mid \right) $$ (1)                                        pi is the proportion of the i-th amplification site, n represents the total number of amplification site.              Population structure analysis                The model-based program STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html) [69] was applied to assess the population structure of the 134 switchgrass genotypes with 51 ISSRs, SCoTs, and EST-SSRs. The number of subpopulations (K) was set from 1 to 10 based on admixture models and correlated band frequencies. With 5â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>105 Markov Chain Monte Carlo replications carried out for each run after a burn-in period of 106 iterations, 20 independent runs were performed per K. When there was a clear maximum value for posterior probability [LnP(D)] output in STRUCTURE, a K value was selected in the range of 1 to 10 subpopulations. The most probable K value was the Î<U+0094>K, an ad hoc quantity related to the rate of change in LnP(D) between successive K inferred by STRUCTURE [70]. The replication of K showing the maximum likelihood was applied to subdivide the genotypes into different groups with membership probabilitiesâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¥â<U+0080><U+0089>0.75. Genotypes with less than 0.75 membership probabilities were assigned to an admixed group. Bar charts from the STRUCTURE data were displayed using Distruct 1.1 [71].                A dendrogram was drawn using FreeTree and TreeView programs (http://web.natur.cuni.cz/flegr/freetree.php) [72] based on Nei-Li genetic similarity coefficient with unweighted pair group method average (UPGMA) clustering.                To reveal relationships among the 134 switchgrass genotypes, a figure of two-dimensional scatterplots representing all of the genotypes was obtained for principal coordinate analysis (PCA) using NTsys-pc v.2.1 [73]. All of the switchgrass individuals were analyzed to calculate MRD [74]. The resulting genetic distance matrices were double-centered and used to obtain eigenvectors by the modules DCENTER and EIGEN using NTsys-pc.              Evaluation of linkage disequilibrium                The significance of pairwise LD was evaluated using squared band-frequency correlations (r2) between all combinations of marker loci using the package TASSEL version 2.1 (http://www.maizegenetics.net/bioinformatics) [75]. Rare bands with a band frequency of less than 5 % were removed to avoid biased evaluations of LD because of their large variances. Other pairs of bands were evaluated with a minor band frequency of at least 5 % (MAFâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¥â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05) with the GDA 1.1 program [76].              ConclusionsThe results of this study showed a great level of genetic variation among switchgrass germplasm. The switchgrass accessions were clearly divided into two groups containing upland and lowland ecotypes. For the first time, we revealed the extent of LD and population structure in switchgrass. The implications of these results in terms of utilizing association mapping for genes or QTL discovery in switchgrass were discussed. For further association mapping using a collection of switchgrass samples, we highly recommend the inclusion of more lowland ecotypes or the use of other nuclear markers in conjunction with ISSR, SCoT and EST-SSR.Abbreviations                CTAB:                     cetyltrimethylammonium bromide                  EMR:                     effective multiplex ratio                  EST-SSR:                     expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats marker                  H:                     Neiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s gene diversity index                  I:                     Shannonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s information index                  Ibav                           :                     band informativeness                  IRAP:                     inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism                  ISSR:                     inter simple sequence repeat marker                  LD:                     linkage disequilibrium                  LL:                     lowland ecotypes                  MI:                     marker index                  MRD:                     modified Rogers distances                  NPB:                     number of polymorphic bands                  PCA:                     principal coordinate analyses                  PPB:                     percentage of polymorphic bands                  SCoT:                     start codon targeted marker                  SSR:                     simple sequence repeat marker                  TNB:                     total number of bands                  UL:                     upland ecotypes                  UPGMA:                     unweighted pair group method average                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National High-Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China (No. 2012AA101801-02), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 31201845), the spring plan of Ministry of Education, and the Sichuan Agricultural University Students Innovation Plan (No. 121062603).

Marker validation is essential for QTL studies, but the cost and workload are considerable when large numbers of markers need to be verified. Marker systems with low development costs would be most suitable for this task.                                Results                 We have tested allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tetra markers and a genotyping tool based on the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I to verify randomly selected SNP markers identified previously either with a SNP array or by genotyping by sequencing in rice and mungbean, respectively. The genotyping capacity of allele-specific PCR and tetra markers was affected by the sequence context surrounding the SNP; SNPs located in repeated sequences and in GC-rich stretches could not be correctly identified. In contrast, CEL-I digestion of mixed fragments produced from test and reference DNA reliably pinpointed the correct genotypes, yet scoring of the genotypes became complicated when multiple SNPs were present in the PCR fragments. A cost analysis showed that as long the sample number remains small, CEL-I genotyping is more cost-effective than tetra markers.

Marker validation is essential for QTL studies, but the cost and workload are considerable when large numbers of markers need to be verified. Marker systems with low development costs would be most suitable for this task.                              Results                We have tested allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tetra markers and a genotyping tool based on the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I to verify randomly selected SNP markers identified previously either with a SNP array or by genotyping by sequencing in rice and mungbean, respectively. The genotyping capacity of allele-specific PCR and tetra markers was affected by the sequence context surrounding the SNP; SNPs located in repeated sequences and in GC-rich stretches could not be correctly identified. In contrast, CEL-I digestion of mixed fragments produced from test and reference DNA reliably pinpointed the correct genotypes, yet scoring of the genotypes became complicated when multiple SNPs were present in the PCR fragments. A cost analysis showed that as long the sample number remains small, CEL-I genotyping is more cost-effective than tetra markers.                              Conclusions                CEL-I genotyping performed better in terms of genotyping accuracy and costs than tetra markers. The method is highly useful for validating SNPs in small to medium size germplasm panels.              KeywordsSingle nucleotide polymorphismGenotypingPCR-based markersCEL-IBackgroundSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become the most widely used marker system for plant and animal genetic analyses. SNP arrays are available for a number of plant and animal species [1] and tools combining SNP detection and genotyping such as genotyping by sequencing (GBS) made the use of these markers in genetic studies feasible and affordable for virtually any organism, including non-model species (recently reviewed by [2]). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses may yield a considerable number of markers that require verification of their correctness and diagnostic capacity to predict a phenotype. Depending on the number of markers to be tested, SNP marker validation can be even more costly and laborious than the genotyping experiment itself.Several assay types are available for verifying SNP markers generated by GBS, SNP chips or similar technologies. Cost-effective commercial SNP assays are available [3], but the cost saving promised by these assays are only attained in routine genotyping, when large sample numbers are analyzed with the same assay. For validation, the number of genotypes used for testing a candidate marker is typically small, and only a few of these markers will be chosen for routine genotyping, while most markers will be discarded. In this situation, the high development costs for commercial assays are not compensated for by their low running costs, making these markers an expensive option for validation experiments. What is more, commercial SNP genotyping tools such as KASP or Taqman assays require specialized laboratory equipment, which might not be available in every genotyping lab, especially not in developing countries. Consequently, for marker validation, simple SNP genotyping tools with low development costs are preferred.Conversion of SNP markers to cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers is often used as a PCR-based method to genotype SNP markers [4], but similar to commercial kits, the method might not be practical for SNP validation. First, only a fraction of SNP markers can be converted to CAPS markers, and second, the restriction enzymes for CAPS assays cause similarly high development costs like commercial assays. dCAPS markers overcome the need for the SNP to fall within a restriction enzyme recognition site and eliminate the limitation that only a fraction of SNPs can be converted to dCAPS [5], but the marker development costs remain high, as a restriction enzyme is required to distinguish the SNP alleles. PCR with allele-specific primers of different length has been proposed as a simple and cost-effective tool for PCR-based SNP genotyping [6]. This method is very cheap and easy to perform, but may be constrained by the sequence context around the SNP, which restricts the options for primer design. Similarly, tetra-primer amplification has been described as an efficient low cost method for genotyping SNP markers [7–9]. This method uses two locus-specific outer primers that asymmetrically flank the SNP under investigation, and two allele-specific inner primers, which produce a larger fragment for one allele, and a smaller fragment for the second allele. The bands of different size produced by one inner and outer primer pair can be easily detected on polyacrylamide or agarose gels [8]. To increase the specificity of the genotyping assay, an additional mismatch base near the 3' end of the allele-specific primers can be added [8, 9]. The method may not work well for SNPs in cytosine and guanine-rich DNA regions, and restrictions for choosing the inner (allele-specific) primers may limit the assay performance and require laborious adjustments and assay optimization [10].SNP genotyping using the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I has been proposed previously [11, 12]. The mismatch-specific nuclease CEL-I is extracted at low cost by ammonium sulfate precipitation from common celery [13, 14]. It detects mismatches in DNA double strands with high sensitivity and is commonly used to identify point mutations in methods known as TILLING and Eco-TILLING [15]. CEL-I was used to genotype SNPs present in mixtures of relatively large PCR fragments (2,000 bp) derived from two individuals after denaturation and re-naturation of the fragments [11]. Previously reported protocols require stopping the enzyme reaction by adding EDTA, or even removing excess salt and concentrating the samples through precipitation, making the method relatively laborious [11].Rice is the most important field crop in Asia and mungbean is increasingly used as a rotation crop in rice production systems. Marker-assisted selection is routinely performed in rice breeding and becomes also popular for mungbean [16, 17]. Therefore, the present case study aimed to evaluate the performance and costs of low cost PCR-based SNP assays on these two crops. We have tested allele-specific PCR, tetra PCR and CEL-I digestion for their capacity to correctly validate the presence of SNPs previously identified in a rice germplasm panel genotyped by a GoldenGate assay, and in a bi-parental mungbean population, where SNPs were identified by GBS. Special consideration was given to streamline the assays to keep costs and labor requirements as low as possible. An ideal assay should have no or only minimal need for optimization, enabling designing and running a large number of assays for validation at minimal effort and cost. Therefore, in this study, no optimization and primer redesign was performed before assessing the performance and costs of the marker assays.MethodsPlant material and SNP markers                In a previous work, a set of 26 local Vietnamese Oryza sativa spp. japonica and spp. indica rice cultivars held in the National Crop Genebank of the Plant Resources Center of the Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam, were submitted to genetic diversity analysis at the Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biotechnology Division of the International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Philippines, using a 288 SNPs sub-set of the 384-SNP GoldenGate chip on a Fluidigm EP1 system according to [18]. From the genotyping results, five SNPs were chosen at random for validation with allele-specific primers, tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping (Table 1). In total 10 out of the 26 lines (R1, R4, R5, R7, R10, R15, R17, R18, R20 and R25) were chosen for SNP validation by sequencing, as these lines, according to the GoldenGate assay, displayed different combinations of the 5 SNPs in homozygote or heterozygote state.Table 1                        Outer and inner primer for tetra markers for rice.

Putative SNP markers were identified in populations V2802 x NM94 and TC1966 x NM92 by genotyping by sequencing [17]. Eight putative SNPs detected in this effort were selected at random for testing tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping (Table 2).

PCR-fragments for sequencing were produced from DNA of the rice and mungbean genotypes using the outer primers listed in Tables 1 and 2. The PCR fragments were submitted to Sanger sequencing at Genomics Ltd, Taiwan and the forward and reverse sequence reads were assembled and analyzed in DNAStar version 7.1.              Allele-specific PCR                The allele-specific PCR technique was applied as described by [6]. This method uses three primers: a common forward primer and two allele-specific reverse primers, where the 3' prime end is specific for a SNP allele. In addition, each of the allele-specific primers contained a mismatch base near the 3' end to destabilize the hybridization with the target sequence and increase the specifity of the allele-specific primer. One allele-specific primer contained a five base random extension at the 5' site, and the primer for the second allele contained a 15 base extension, where the five 5' bases corresponded to the extension of the first primer. The different length of the primers should result in size differences of the amplification products derived from the different alleles visible after gel electrophoresis of the PCR fragments. Primers were designed after retrieving the SNP sequence context in the O. sativa reference at http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/ using Primer3 http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/. The primer sequences and the amplicon sizes are shown in Table 3. PCR was performed on 20 ng genomic DNA in 15 µl reactions containing 0.2 µM of each primer, 200 µM of deoxyribonucleotides, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase on a DNA Gradient PCR machine (BIORAD) with an amplification profile of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles with 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at an assay-specific temperature from 48 °C to 65 °C for 45 s, elongation at 72 °C for 45 s and terminal elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products (2 µL/sample) were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining under UV light.Table 3                        Allele-specific primers for rice                      Locus namePrimer nameFragment lengthCommon primerAllele-specific primer 1Allele-specific primer 24:22435296AS1219CGACAGGGAGAAATCCTGAA5’-GACTTGGCAGGTAAAACAGGTTACG-3'5’-CACTACAAAGGCTGTGGCAGGTAAAACAGGATAGA-3'5:44806AS2189GCCTTGCAGGCTCCTATTTT5’-AGTCAAAGCTTCAGGCTCTAGCTGC-3’5’-CGACTAACTGTGACTAAGCTTCAGGCTCTAGCATA-3’6:14504992AS3209CCTTGCCCTGTTATTCCTGA5’-CCAGTTTTCTCCTTGTGCCAGATTG-3’5’-GATGTCTACTCCAGTTTTCTCCTTGTGCCAGAGAA-3’7:3650191AS4293CAAGTTTGTAGGTGCTGACCA5’-GATCCTAACTGAAGTGAAAACAGCA3’5’-TGCGTCATAGGATCCTAACTGAAGTGAAAACACAC-3’9:6982338AS5162TTCTTGGGGTTGGCTACAAG5’-ACTGCTGTACTTGTATTTGCCGCAC-3’5’-CATTGTATTTTTACGTGTACTTGTATTTGCCGATT-3                      The allele-specific base, as well as the additionally introduced variant base near the 3’end are underlined. The primer extension sequences are printed in small letters. The fragment length excludes the extensions of the allele-specific primers                                  Tetra marker                Outer and inner primers for tetra markers were designed in Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/) using the rice and mungbean reference sequences (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/ and http://plantgenomics.snu.ac.kr/mediawiki-1.21.3/index.php/Main_Page). The additional mismatch base usually introduced for tetra ARMS PCR [8] was not applied in our experiment. The outer and inner primers of the tetra markers are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The PCR reactions were set up as described for allele-specific primers. The amplification profile was 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products (3 µl) were size-fractionated on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with 5 µg/mL-1 ethidium bromide and the bands were visualized under ultraviolet light. Tetra markers were tested on five SNPs of rice landraces and on eight SNPs of mungbean mapping parents.              CEL-I SNP genotyping method                500 g celery was purchased at a local farmer’s market. Leaves were removed and the stems were blended in a juicer. CEL-I was enriched through (NH4)2SO4 precipitation as described by [15]. Desalted CEL-I extract was stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Test digestions using 0.5 to 2.5 µl CEL-I extract showed that 1 µl were optimal for genotyping. The CEL-I working solution for each reaction contained 1 µL CEL-I enzyme, 1.5 µL CEL-I buffer and 7.5 µL distilled deionized water. 10× CEL-I buffer contained 1 M MgSO4, 1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 2 M KCl, 10% Triton X-100, and 20 mg/ml BSA. PCR fragments produced with the outer primers of the tetra markers described above were used for CEL-I genotyping. PCR products derived from different plant lines were mixed in a ratio of a 1:1 ratio (v/v). For genotyping progenies of mapping parents, two assays per sample were prepared. In one assay the DNA of the progeny was mixed with DNA of mapping parent one, and in the second assay it was mixed with DNA of mapping parent two. For genotyping mapping parents, also two assays per locus were performed. In one assay the DNA of one mapping parent was mixed with the DNA of the other parent, and in the second assay the DNA of each mapping parent was genotyped separately. When the SNP base was identical with the base present in the DNA mixed with the sample, no cut by CEL-I was obtained, while in the presence of one or more polymorphic bases, CEL-I could introduce a cut into the fragment. This way, the reference, variant or heterozygote genotype at SNP base located in the tested PCR fragments could be determined. For the assay, the DNA double strands were denaturated by incubation at 99 °C for 10 min, reannealing the stands by cooling down to 70 °C, and subsequently reducing the incubation temperature from 70 °C to 49 °C in 70 cycles with -0.3 °C intervals per 20 s. 10 µl ice-cold CEL-I working solution was added to the sample on ice, mixed and incubated at different temperatures. For PCR fragments of less than 300 bp, the usually suggested CEL-I treatment incubation temperature of 45 °C was too high and yielded strong background and weak bands, while a temperature of 36 °C seemed to be suitable to yield bands after specifically cutting mismatch bases (Fig. 1). For the CEL-I genotyping in the current study, the samples were incubated at 34 °C for 10 min and then cooled down to -20 °C. Electrophoresis and DNA fragment visualization was performed as described for tetra markers. A simplified version of CEL-I digestion was performed by performing PCR on DNA mixtures, rather than mixing fragments post-PCR.                                          Fig. 1                        Optimization of the incubation temperature for CEL-I treatment. The SNP tested was tetra_12. Incubation at 36 ° was found to be optimal to specifically cut at the mismatch site in position 171 bp of the 269 bp fragment, producing bands with 170 and 99 bp. The additional smaller band below around 90 bp is probably due to the sequence context around the SNP (please refer to the discussion)                                    ResultsSNP validation in rice by sequencing and testing allele-specific PCR, tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping                In total, five SNPs detected through the 384-SNP GoldenGate (Indica x Indica) array were selected for verification. Before testing PCR-based genotyping on these SNPs, the SNP data obtained from the GoldenGate array were verified by sequencing on 11 rice landraces (Table 4).Table 4                        SNPs among rice landraces selected from Golden Gate genotyping data                      Golden Gate dataSequencing dataLocus namePrimer nameRefVarR1R4R5R7R10R15R17R18R20R21R254:22435296tetra_1GAGGGGGAGGGGG5:44806tetra_2CGGCCSCCCCCCC6:14504992tetra_3GAGGGGGGGGGRA7:3650191tetra_4ACCAAAAAAAAAA9:6982338tetra_5CTCCCCCCCCCCC                      Ref.: reference sequence, Var.: variant. R1 – R25: rice landrace accession number                                    Allele-specific PCR, in addition to the allele-specific bands, yielded several secondary bands for tetra_1, but still genotypes were predicted correctly except for one case (R14). The allele-specific markers for tetra _3 predicted heterozygote genotypes for 21 out of 26 genotypes (Fig. 2) and revealed the correct genotype only in one sample (R25). The other allele-specific primers did not produce bands that distinguished the SNP alleles (data not shown). This result showed that allele-specific primers as designed for this experiment are not useful for genotyping SNPs in rice samples. Allele-specific primers were not tested on mungbean.                                          Fig. 2                        Genotyping of rice using allele-specific markers. a) Tetra_1, b) Tetra_3. The SNP bases are indicated at the bottom of the gel images. The top row shows the allele-specific PCR results, and the SNP array genotyping or sequencing results are shown in the bottom row                                      Testing tetra markers on these SNPs showed that markers tetra_1, 2 and 3 had the tendency to show heterozygote genotypes, although the accessions were homozygote at the tested loci. The A variant for the G/A SNP in tetra_1 was correctly recognized by tetra markers, while most G variants were erroneously genotyped as G/A heterozygotes (Fig. 3). The G/A SNP of tetra_1 was located between G residues, which might have affected the specific initiation of amplification by primer for the G-allele. The SNP in tetra_2 was located in a repeat sequence (AGCTTG), and the C-specific primer initiated polymerase chain reaction at the target site and at the second AGCTTG motif located 13 bp upstream the target sequence in all samples with the C allele present. In addition, the inner primer for the G allele was not specific and amplified a fragment in all samples suggesting erroneous heterozygote genotypes. Tetra marker tetra_3 gave in many cases erroneous heterozygote genotypes, as the inner reverse primer specific for the A allele yielded products, albeit at low amounts, when only the G allele was present. Only tetra markers tetra_4 gave the correct genotypes and detected the C-variant in R1. Tetra_5 scored seven homozygous samples. In contrast, CEL-I genotyping reliably detected all heterozygote and homozygote SNPs correctly (Fig. 4). The G/A SNP between R4 and R15, as well as the heterozygote G/C in R7 and the G/C SNP between R18 and R1 were correctly detected. The same with tetra_3, the heterozygote base in R21 and the SNP among lines R10 and R25 were detected. Also the SNPs in tetra 4 between R1 and R25 and R1 and R20 were correctly detected. Tetra-5 did not contain any SNP, therefore no CEL-I cut was observed in this fragment.

Sequencing confirmed the SNPs for tetra_6, 7, 9, 12 and 13, but not for tetra_8, 10 and 11 (Table 5). In addition to the SNPs previously found by genotyping by sequencing, Sanger sequencing of the PCR fragments produced with the outer tetra primers resulted in additional SNPs for tetra 6, 7, 9, 10 and 13. The outer primers for tetra_11 did not yield any product from TC1966 and therefore could not be sequenced. Tetra-11 was monomorphic between NM94 and V2802 and tetra_8 was monomorphic between all mapping parents. The amplicon of tetra_10 contained several heterozygous sites in all mapping parents, but sequencing did not corroborate the presence of the G/A polymorphism predicted by GBS. This sequencing exercise showed that 3 out of the 8 selected SNPs predicted by GBS were erroneous, probably due to wrong mapping of GBS tags to the reference sequence, and due to insufficient sequencing depth.Table 5                        Mungbean SNPs detected by genotyping by sequencing among the mapping parents NM92, NM94, TC1966 and V2802 and targeted for genotyping by tetra markers and CEL-I                      GBS dataSequencing dataLocus namePrimer nameSNP Position in PCR fragmentNM92TC1966NM94V2802NM92TC1966NM94V28021:26,370,595tetra_6144TATTTATT2:23,741,639tetra_7181TTTATTTA3:11,561,441tetra_8-CGCCC                              C                            cc3:10,830,938tetra_9200GGGAGGGA5:9,090,455tetra_10-GAGGG,                              G                            GG7:13,713,780tetra_11-AAAGAAA                              A                            10:3,159,416tetra_12171CGCGCGCG12:9,262,432tetra_13140TCCCTCCC                      The numbers refer to the position of the SNP in the PCR fragment obtained from the mapping parents using the outer tetra primers.

Genotyping of F7 populations TC1966 x NM92 and/or V2802 x NM94 with tetra_6, 7, 9 and 12 showed the segregation of the SNP genotype in the populations (Additional file 1) and suggested that the tetra markers were appropriate for genotyping populations.                                          Fig. 5                        Test of tetra markers tetra-6, 7, 8, 9, 10 11, 12 and 13 on 4 mungbean mapping parents TV1966, NM92, V2802 and NM94. The bands indicating the SNP base are labeled with arrows                                      The outer primers of the tetra markers were used to amplify fragments from genomic DNA of the mapping parents containing the putative SNP sites. PCR amplification products from TC1966 were pooled with those from NM92, and products from NM94 were pooled with those from V2802. The pure samples and the mixtures were submitted to CEL-I treatment. In un-pooled PCR fragments obtained from the four mapping parents, CEL-I cutting was observed at the heterozygous bases in fragments of tetra_6, 7 and 8 in NM92 and tetra_10 in all mapping parents (Fig. 6, Table 6). High background was obtained with tetra_9 from all mapping parents. This fragment contained microsatellite-like motifs, which could have led to destabilization of the DNA double strand of the short fragments and could have transiently created cutting sites for CEL-I. Further reduction of the reaction temperature to avoid this effect was not tried. CEL-I treatment of mixtures of SNP-containing PCR fragments of the mapping parents resulted in the expected DNA fragments for all loci (Fig. 6, Tables 5 and 6). In addition to the cuts at heterozygote sites, in mixtures of tetra_6 PCR fragments from NM92 and TC1966, an additional cut was produced at position 144 (Fig. 6a). In tetra_7, as expected from the sequencing data, the heterozygous site at position 181 of the PCR fragment from NM92 caused a CEL-I cut, resulting in a 181 and a 79 bp band, while in mixtures of NM94/V2802 PCR fragments CEL-I genotyping correctly showed the T/A polymorphism in position 181 of the fragment (Fig. 6b, Tables 5 and 6). The monomorphic locus tetra_8 remained un-cut by CEL-I, cuts were introduced at the heterozygous sites in NM92 (Fig. 6c, Table 6). Tetra_10 gave a complex pattern due to the presence of multiple SNPs in the PCR fragment (Table 6), while CEL-I restriction of tetra_11 fragments gave no cuts, as expected for these monomorphic fragments. Mixtures of fragments of tetra_12 from TC1966 and NM92, as well as from V2802 and NM94 gave the expected cuts at the SNP position 171 of the PCR fragment. Similarly mixtures of PCR fragments of tetra_13 from TC1966 and NM92 gave the expected pattern of cut bands at the SNP site.                                          Fig. 6                        CEL-I test genotyping on pure and mixed DNA of 4 mungbean mapping parents for tetra_6 (a), tetra_7 (b), tetra_8 (c), tetra_9 (d), tetra_10 (e), tetra_11 (f), tetra_12 (g), and tetra_13 (h). CEL-I cuts at mismatch sites. Mismatches can appear at heterozygote sites in one genotype (as in NM92 with tetra_6 (a) in positions 60/65 and 94, or at SNP sites when PCR fragments from homozygote mapping parents are mixed, as in tetra_6 at position 144 of TC1966/NM92, or in tetra_12 (g). The SNPs among the mapping parents and the heterozygote loci causing the CEL-I fragments are labeled on the figures and listed in Tables 5 and 6                                                          Table 6                        Mungbean SNPs found by Sanger sequencing of PCR fragments produced with the outer tetra marker primers.

Instead of mixing the PCR fragments of the families with the fragments of the mapping parents, the PCR mastermix was spiked with either parent 1 or parent 2 DNA before amplification. For each sample, two amplification reactions were performed, one with parent 1 and another with parent 2-spiked DNA in order to detect heterozygous SNPs. Scoring of CEL-I genotyping was simple on amplicons with a single SNP like in tetra_12, but was also feasible when additional SNPs or heterozygous sites were present, like in tetra_9. By comparing the genotypes of the parent 1- and parent 2-spiked families, homozygote and heterozygote genotypes could be distinguished easily (Additional file 2). For example, for tetra_9 samples 14 and 128 showed the cut bands in both, NM94 and V2802-spiked CEL_I reactions, indicating that the samples are heterozygote for the tetra_9 SNP (Additional file 2).              Validation of SNP markers - Cost and working time considerations                Using commercial SNP assays for marker validation is relatively expensive. For mapping experiments dealing with complex traits involving many loci and numerous markers associated with them, the validation costs for candidate markers may surpass the genotyping costs. Table 7 shows a comparison of reagent costs and working time for different marker systems including CAPS (dCAPS), tetra markers, and CEL-I assays. Allele-specific markers were excluded from the calculation, as they did not perform sufficiently well in our experiments to be considered as a validation tool. DNA extraction costs were not considered, as these costs were equal for all listed assays. Many different restriction enzymes are required to cover SNPs in different sequence contexts, therefore developing new CAPS or dCAPS markers often requires purchasing new restriction enzymes. For the calculation in Table 7 we assumed that for every third SNP a new kind of restriction enzyme has to be purchased. The cost of supplies to develop a marker assay are clearly highest for CAPS markers, followed by tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping. The time for designing and testing the markers is assumed to be higher for tetra and CAPS markers than for CEL-I genotyping. Mainly due to the restriction enzyme costs, CAPS development remains the most expensive system. For routine genotyping, CEL-I would be the most expensive and laborious option, as two assays must be performed for each locus to distinguish homozygote from heterozygote variants. Therefore, for marker validation on a small number of samples, where mostly marker development costs play a role, CEL-I genotyping seems to be cheapest; for genotyping a larger sample, tetra markers are more cost-effective.Table 7                        Estimation of development and running costs for (d)CAPS, tetra marker and CEL-I-based genotyping (in US$)                      Development costs CAPS (dCAPS)Tetra markerCEL-IPrimer7.5157.5Restriction enzyme30 1PCR reagents0.480.480.96Gel electrophoresis and DNA band detection0.060.060.12TOTAL38.0415.549.58Work load Approximate working time for development 1 assay (h)0.250.250.1 Working time for testing0.120.080.12TOTAL0.370.330.22Routine analysis Hands-on time per assay (assuming 96 assays per run, in h)0.030.0250.06 Reagent costs per assay0.130.1050.19              DiscussionValidation of molecular markers for breeding may require testing many candidate markers. Only a few of them will be adopted for marker-assisted selection, while most markers may be discarded. Consequently, marker validation may constitute a major cost factor. In order to keep validation costs low and to avoid the need for expensive instruments, SNPs are often converted to PCR-based markers. We have tested allele-specific PCR, tetra markers and a CEL-I based genotyping method for validating selected SNP markers derived from an array-based SNP genotyping study on rice and from a GBS experiment in mungbean. In parallel, the targeted SNPs were validated by sequencing. As expected, not all SNPs pinpointed by the GBS experiment were true SNPs. Two of the putative SNPs of mungbean were in fact monomorphic. In mungbean, chromosomal rearrangements or an indel in the GBS tag in comparison to the reference sequence [20] led to erroneous mapping and resulted in false positive SNPs. In general array-based genotyping is considered more accurate than GBS, nevertheless GBS is widely used for genotyping rice [21], mungbean [17] and other crops. Shallow sequencing and erroneous mapping of sequence tags in GBS can yield wrong genotypes, but GBS is more cost effective than array-based genotyping and has the additional advantage that no previous information on the SNPs present in the samples is required [22].Allele-specific PCR was unsuitable to genotype SNPs in the rice samples without assay optimization and therefore was abandoned. The accuracy of tetra marker genotyping was affected by the sequence context. Introduction of a sequence mismatch near the 3' end of the primers to increase stability might have overcome this problem [8] but was not tested, as the study addressed only the least work- intensive SNP genotyping. Optimization of the SNP assays beyond gradient PCR to determine the optimal annealing temperature for the allele-specific and tetra primers was avoided, as the study aimed to assess the performance of the assays without laborious modifications.Previously published CEL-I protocols proved to be useful for SNP validation and genotyping [11, 12], but could be simplified to make the assays cheaper and easier to use. Stopping the CEL-I reaction by adding EDTA, as described by published protocols, was found to be unnecessary; similarly, the previously suggested desalting of the reaction mixtures prior to loading the DNA on the gel was eliminated, without affecting the scoring of the bands. Lowering the reaction temperature of CEL-I below 36 °C was essential to reduce the background. CEL-I genotyping for validation of SNP markers was the least costly method to develop, but the method required more resources per locus than tetra markers for genotyping large numbers of samples. Either PCR fragments containing the SNP have to be mixed after PCR, or DNA to be genotyped must be spiked with reference DNA. For each sample and locus, two CEL-I reactions have to be performed to distinguish homozygote from heterozygote genotypes, making the genotyping more expensive and more laborious. From our perspective, mixing DNA before PCR is the preferred CEL-I genotyping method, as spiking of the PCR master mix is less laborious and safer than handling the PCR fragments for combination after amplification. CEL-I genotyping also was more reliable than tetra markers, which may be affected by the sequence context of the SNP and require additional optimization of the assay, leading to longer development times and higher costs. However, CEL-I based genotyping was tedious on heterozygote samples, as the banding pattern became quite complex and difficult to score with increasing heterozygosity of the mapping parents.It can be expected that more modern genotyping tools such as KASP markers [23] are more accurate than the methods presented here, but require equipment such as a plate reader that might not be available to all users of molecular markers. By adopting an improved protocol for CEL-I genotyping we wanted to provide a simple and cheap method for genotyping for laboratories that lack specialized equipment.ConclusionsAllele-specific PCR was not suitable to genotype SNPs in rice. The genotyping accuracy of tetra markers was affected by low allele specifity of the inner primers, repeat sequences and nucleotide runs. In contrast, genotyping by using CEL-I digestion at low incubation temperatures performed well and was independent of the sequence context around the SNP. It was also more cost effective than tetra markers, as long as the number of tested samples remained small. Additional SNPs to the SNP selected for genotyping present in the PCR fragment can make scoring of CEL-I genotypes tedious. Therefore, PCR fragments for CEL-I genotyping should be kept small to minimize the presence of additional SNPs.Abbreviations                ARMS PCR:                     Amplification-refractory mutation system PCR                  BSA:                     Bovine serum albumin                  CAPS:                     Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence                  CTAB:                     Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide                  dCAPS:                     Derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences                  EDTA:                     Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid                  GBS:                     Genotyping by sequencing                  HEPES:                     4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid                  KASP:                     Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR                  PCR:                     Polymerase chain reaction                  QTL:                     Quantitative trait locus                  SNP:                     Single nucleotide polymorphism                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe thank the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, for co-funding the study.

Finally, we provided a summary of the candidate loci associated with pigmentation, which could be a valuable reference for further evolutionary and medical studies.                              Conclusion                Previous studies generally indicated a complex genetic mechanism underlying the skin color variation, expanding our understanding of the role of population demographic history and natural selection in shaping genetic and phenotypic diversity in humans. Future work is needed to dissect the genetic architecture of skin color adaptation in numerous ethnic minority groups around the world, which remains relatively obscure compared with that of major continental groups, and to unravel the exact genetic basis of skin color adaptation.              KeywordsSkin colorNatural selectionGenetic adaptationModern humansArchaic homininBackgroundSince modern humans ventured out of Africa ~100,000 years ago, they spread across continents into a variety of habitats, from tropical zones to the arctic, and from lowlands to highlands. During migration, selective pressures in local environments (e.g., the cold climate, hypoxia, and endemic pathogens), together with random drift, have resulted in population-specific genetic variants, which further influenced variable phenotypes, such as lactose tolerance, height, immune system, and metabolic efficiency.Skin color variation is one of the most striking examples of human phenotypic diversity. It is dominated by melanin, a pigmentation located in the base of the epidermis and produced by melanocytes. Melanin has two forms, pheomelanin (yellow-reddish) and eumelanin (black-brown). The former is mainly accumulated in the light-complexioned people, while the latter is mostly produced in the dark-complexioned people [1–5]. In addition, the number and size of melanin particles differ among individuals, and is even more important than the proportions of the two forms of melanin in the determination of human skin color [5]. Other skin-related factors, e.g., keratin, also contribute to skin color variation [6, 7].In global populations, skin color is highly correlated with latitude, and fundamentally, the distribution of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Fig. 1). Populations closer to the equator tend to have dark skin for protection against UV, since overexposure to UV may decrease folic acid levels [8, 9] and cause skin cancer [10–13]. The lighter skin in populations at higher latitudes is underlying selection to maintain vitamin D photosynthesis, which is a UV-dependent process [14, 15].                                      Fig. 1                      Correlation between skin color and latitude (from Barsh (2003) [5]). (a) A map of human skin color distribution. (b) A plot of skin reflectance against latitude                    Although UV has been assumed to be a driving force for the evolution of human skin colors, understanding the exact genetic mechanism of selection would be crucial to reconstruct human evolutionary history and elucidate the microevolution of adaptive traits. Describing a full picture of regional skin color adaptation in humans would be challenging because it includes not only the genes identified to be under selection, but also the extent to which these genes could explain phenotypic variation, the interactions and joint effects of genes, and the way they react to the external environments. In this article, we reviewed several cases of skin color adaptation in various populations of modern humans and archaic hominins. These cases show the similarities and differences of mechanisms of skin color adaptation across populations, and provide some insights into human evolutionary history.Skin color adaptation in modern Eurasians                In Europeans, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 [16–19] are two golden genes related to the evolution of the light skin color. SLC24A5 encodes the NCKX5 protein, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family and regulates the calcium concentration in the melanosome [16]. This gene has been confirmed to affect pigmentation in zebrafish and mice [16, 20]. Especially, the derived allele of rs1426654 in SLC24A5 was found to be nearly fixed in Europeans, but almost missing in populations without any European ancestry (Fig. 2) [21]. A 78-kb haplotype around SLC24A5, which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1426654, was also identified to accumulate in Europeans [22]. A similar pattern can be observed at rs16891982 in SLC45A2 [23], which has been reported to be associated with pigmentation in several species, e.g., mice, fish, birds, and horses [24–26]. Other variants in this gene, including rs26722, rs2287949, and rs40132, were also shown to be coloration-associated in Europeans [23, 27, 28]. Another important pigmentation-related gene identified in European is MC1R [29–31]. This gene is expressed in melanocytes and plays a key role in controlling the switch from pheomelanin to eumelanin [31]. The pigmentary phenotypes associated with MC1R has been studied in a wide range of animals [32–34]. Many variants have been identified in MC1R, such as rs1805007, rs1805008, and rs3212357 [35, 36], despite its small size (951 bp). Other important European-specific loci include rs1393350 in TYR, rs2733831 in TYRP1, and rs1900758 in OCA2 [17, 28, 37–39]. The derived allele frequencies at these loci are high in Europeans but low in Africans and East Asians, which could be a clear signal of positive selection in Europeans, as indicated by statistical analysis [40].                                          Fig. 2                        Evolutionary model of human pigmentation in three continental populations. The rooted tree shows the genetic phylogeny of human populations from Africa, North Europe and East Asia, with the colors of the branches roughly indicating the generalized skin pigmetation level of these populations (adapted from McEvoy et al. (2006) [39]). Genetic loci reported to be under positive selection in the common ancestor of modern Eurasians are represented by rs1881227 in KITLG, and those independently evolved in Europeans and East Asians, indicating possible convergent evolution, are represented by rs12913832 in OCA2 and rs885479 in MC1R, respectively. The maps of allele frequency were drawn using R (version 3.2.1, https://www.r-project.org), based on these loci in 53 global populations provided by the Human Genome Diversity Panel CEPH (HGDP, http://www.hagsc.org/hgdp/index.html). Blue and red colors denote the ancestral and derived alleles, respectively                                      Genes involved in the skin color adaptation in East Asians are not that well studied compared to the long list of adaptive genes identified in Europeans. Notable examples include OCA2 and MC1R. Each harbors several non-synonymous mutations, e.g. rs1800414 and rs74653330 in OCA2, and rs885479 in MC1R [40–43], which exhibit high derived allele frequencies in East Asians, but low derived allele frequencies in Europeans and Africans (Fig. 2). The OCA2 protein is thought to be a mature melanosomal membrane protein [44], with a potential role in protein transportation into melanosomes [45]. The East Asian-specific variant of rs1800414 was first reported in an exome sequencing study aiming to figure out albinism-related variants [46]. The derived allele at rs1800414 was thought to contribute to the skin lightening in an association study of Han Chinese, which measured the skin color of individuals using the melanin index [47]. Another non-synonymous variant in OCA2, rs74653330, has also been confirmed to be pigmentation-related in an association study of Japanese [48]. Additional examples of East Asian-specific pigmentation-associated alleles include rs10809814 in TYRP1 and rs1407995 in DCT [40, 49], both of which show differentiation between Asians and non-Asians [47], and strong signals of positive selections in Asians [43, 49].                Despite distinct genes and variants under respective local adaptations in Europeans and East Asians, some genes have derived alleles reaching high frequencies in both continental groups. For instance, KITLG exhibits a selective sweep in non-Africans [50–52]. This gene is widely expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, and functions in organ morphogenesis and cell proliferation. The Kit-ligand encoded by KITLG is known as the steel factor and plays a crucial role in the normal development and maintenance of the melanocyte lineage in adult skin [53]; this has been proved in human, fish, and mice [54–56]. The effects of this gene on pigmentation have also been confirmed in a series of association studies [57–60]. One of the key variants is rs642742, which is located at 326 kb upstream to the transcription start site of KITLG. At this variant, the ancestral allele frequency is over 90% in Africans, comparable to the derived allele frequency in Europeans and East Asians (Fig. 2). Similar patterns were observed in other genes, e.g., ASIP and BNC2 [39].                Two models of the evolutionary architecture of human pigmentation were proposed on the basis of the above results and other related studies (Fig. 2). One is a convergent evolution model [17, 40, 43, 49], suggesting that depigmentation has, to some degree, evolved independently in Europeans and East Asians, as different genes and variants have been suggested to explain the light skin and positive selection in these two continental groups. A recent study estimated the time of selective sweeps for the European-specific pigmentation variants to be around 11,000–19,000 years ago, after the divergence of Europeans and Asians [61]. An alternative model fits for the shared selective sweeps of Europeans and East Asians, which could possibly occur in proto-Eurasians. The onset of the sweep was estimated to be approximately 30,000 years ago, right after the “Out-of-Africa” migration, but earlier than the European-specific evolution on pigmentation [61]. The coexistence of these two models suggests a complex evolutionary history of skin color in modern humans.                Another clue of the complex genetic basis of skin color evolution is the allelic heterogeneity observed in a single gene, like OCA2 and MC1R. In each of these genes, some alleles are specific to Europeans, whereas others are specific to Asians, although they all have been proved to be depigmentation-related. In addition, OCA2 provides evidence of independent sweeps as well as convergent evolution in Europeans and Asians. Since results were obtained from studies using different samples, data, and methods, there could be some confounding factors leading to these different observations. However, more importantly, skin color is a complex trait that could not be simply explained by a single gene or variant; rather, it is likely to involve a huge network of genes and phenotypes. For instance, ASIP, an adaptive pigmentation gene in populations with European ancestry [62, 63], encodes the agouti signaling protein, which blocks MC1R in the eumelanin synthesis in response to the UV-induced DNA damage [40]. In the melanin production, TYR acts as the catalyzer of the key initial step, and its stability is maintained by TYRP1 and DCT.                In addition, scans for selection on skin pigmentation indicate two different selection behaviors acting on de novo mutations and standing variations, respectively. Some variants, represented by rs1805007 and rs1805008 in MC1R (in Europeans) and rs1800414 in OCA2 (in Asians), only show derived alleles in populations under positive selection at these loci, from which we could conjecture that they are new mutations that appeared after modern humans settled in Europe or Asia. In contrast, some variants, such as rs3212357 in MC1R (under positive selection in Europeans), present low frequencies in Africans. Regardless of possible mutation events and genetic drift in African populations, it is more likely that the derived allele at this locus has presented for some time before they became favored. Similar cases have been found in the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans and the immunity adaptation in some modern human populations, and even in the evolution of pigmentation phenotypes in non-human species [56, 64].              Skin color adaptation in the admixed populations                Admixed populations, the hybrid offspring of two previously isolated populations, may provide important insights in understanding the genetics of geographical variation for two reasons. First, the loci underlying phenotypic differences in ancestral populations are also overlapping the highly informative markers of ancestry, which makes the admixed populations particularly useful for tracing population history. Second, the admixed populations usually have a wide range of variations regarding some specific phenotypes, which may increase the power of locating genes associated with complex traits/diseases after controlling potential population stratification.                Despite these advantages, admixed populations have rarely been considered in studies of human pigmentation variation. Current studies investigating pigmentation genes in admixed populations mainly involved those with African and European ancestry, such as African Americans, European Africans, and Latin Americans, since their ancestral populations are substantially differentiated in skin color. The ancestral genetic makeups differ among these three populations. African-Americans obtained the largest genetic contribution (~80%) from the African ancestry [65], Latin American mestizos have the least proportion of African ancestry (~10%) [66, 67], while in European Africans, the genetic components inherited from Europeans (~42%) and Africans (~58%) are comparable [68]. Uniquely in the Latin Americans, a considerable proportion of Native American ancestry (~45%) exists [66, 67]. Moreover, on the individual level, the proportion of each ancestry exhibits a large variance in each admixed population. For instance, the fraction of European ancestry varies from 2% to 98% among African American individuals [65]. The large variance of skin color in admixed individuals could result from their highly diverse genetic makeup, as a substantial correlation has been observed between ancestry proportion and skin color [68–70].                Multiple well-known candidate genes for pigmentation in Europeans have also been identified by admixture mapping (Fig. 3) or association studies in admixed populations. For instance, TYR, carrying a non-synonymous substitution rs1042602 (S192Y), was identified in African Americans [69] and European Africans from Cape Verde [68]. Variants in ASIP, such as rs6058017, which has been found to occur at different frequencies in global populations [63], were also reported to be associated with dark hair and brown eyes in European Americans [71], African Americans [62] and Brazilians [72]. Furthermore, KITLG showed strong signals of selective sweep in African Americans [51], with a significant preference to homozygotes of the African-specific allele (ancestral allele) at rs642742 in individuals with high melanin index (dark skin) [69]. Similar cases include rs1426654 in SLC24A5 in European Africans [68] and Latin Americans [72], and rs35395 in SLC45A2 in European Africans [68].                                          Fig. 3                        A framework of admixture mapping to detect positive selection. The average faces of African, European, and African America were downloaded from http://www.mediadump.com/hosted-id167-average-faces-from-around-the-world.html#.WLkMU-kfU1A                                                                          However, some studies reported discrepant results. The correlation between Native American ancestry and skin pigmentation reported in a Hispanic population [73] was not observed in a group of Puerto Rican women [70]. One of the key single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNPs) in OCA2, rs1800404, showed a significant effect on skin pigmentation when analyzing African Americans and a combined population of African American and African-Caribbean, but was absent in an independent analysis of the African-Caribbean samples [69]. It is possible that different genetic mechanisms of skin color variation exist in various populations, but cautions should be taken regarding detailed information in the data, such as sample size and the ancestral populations selected for analyzing the admixed populations, which could lead to biased results [67, 69].                The identification of genetic determinants of natural variation of skin pigmentation was also conducted in other admixed populations. One successful example is a genome-wide association study of a population of South Asian descent [74], in which polymorphisms in SLC24A5, TYR and SLC45A2 showed significant associations with the melanin content in skin. The light skin alleles in South Asian could possibly be inherited from their European ancestors [75], who initially arrived at this region around 3500–4000 years ago along with Indo-European language expansion [76], followed by recent colonization in the last few centuries. In addition, Central Asia and Southeast Asia are home to various admixed populations, which are likewise of great potential in the study of skin color adaptation. Admixed population analyses may greatly enrich our understanding of skin color variation in modern human populations.              Skin color adaptation in the aboriginal populations                The aboriginal populations in different areas around the world have many implications for human evolutionary history. They have been regarded as the early settlers in respective areas. Despite having been assimilated by their surrounding agriculturalists to some extent, some aboriginal people have preserved their traditional livelihoods as hunter-gatherers, as well as their original physical traits – dark skin, short stature, and curly hair.                The hunter-gatherer populations with dark skin, short stature and curly hair have attracted much attention (Fig. 4a). The genetic mechanism underlying the shared phenotypes among these geographically distant populations (collectively called Negritos or Pygmies), from Central Africa, the Andaman Islands, Southeast Asia and Oceania, are still controversial; for example, whether they were the common descent from a pre-Neolithic substrate of humanity or a consequence of convergent evolution [77, 78]. To date, most genetic studies on this issue have focused on height [78–81]. One study provided clues for convergent evolution from the view of skin pigmentation adaptation by analyzing MC1R diversity in the Melanesians [82]. This study showed that the ancestral haplotypes of MC1R are not highly conserved between Northern Island Melanesians and Africans, although both populations live in the high UV region, which is in contrast to previous findings based on very limited samples [30, 83]. Besides, a non-synonymous polymorphism, rs2228479, shows enriched derived alleles specifically in East Asians, but is not significantly associated with skin or hair pigmentation in Melanesians. Actually, the Melanesian population exhibits striking skin pigmentation variation [84], and consistently, some variants have been identified to be region-specific, which could partly explain this phenotypic variation. A notable example is a non-synonymous variant, rs387907171, in TYRP1 [85]. It is restricted to the Solomons and parts of the Bismarck Archipelago, and might contribute to the ‘blond hair’ in this region [85, 86]. These results emphasize the complex genetic architecture of pigmentation phenotypes, and also highlight the role that population history (e.g., the complex population history of the Southwest Pacific [87–89]) can play a role in influencing phenotypic diversity. Skin pigmentation studies on other modern aboriginal populations (besides Melanesians) are scarce, except for one investigating the Senoi population (an indigenous population) from the Malay Peninsula, which is an admixture of the Negrito (dark-skinned) and the southern Mongoloid from Indo-China (yellow-brown-skinned), and has a wide skin color spectrum [90]. The authors of this study found that despite the low derived allele frequency, the A111T mutation (rs1426654) in SLC24A5 is significantly associated with the light skin in Senoi, which was suspected to result from the admixture of the Mongoloid and South Asians.

Portraits of Malay and Swedish individuals are provided by the Joshua Project (http://joshuaproject.net), the Bateq portrait is from http://www.businessinsider.my/, and the Inuit portrait is from http://www.arcticphoto.co.uk/                                                                          Another interesting issue concerning human skin color adaptation comes from the arctic people. The Inuit people, in far North Eastern Asia and the American Subarctic, have yellowish-brown skin despite the far northern latitude at which they live, unlike other populations living at the same latitude, such as the Swedes and Finnish (Fig. 4b). This makes the Inuit population an exception of the latitude-correlated distribution of skin color. One possible reason is that the dark skin could protect the Inuits from the severe UV exposure because of the long daylight hours in winter and high levels of UV reflection from the snow. While the dark skin is a disadvantage for vitamin D production, plenty of vitamins including vitamin D could be compensated from their diets [91, 92]. Another cause could be the founder effect of the ancient East Asian ancestry of the Inuits, who have inhabited the arctic region since nearly 5000 years ago, and had higher melanin production than the European ancestry. However, very few genetic studies have been conducted to determine the genetic basis of dark skin in arctic populations.              Skin color adaptation in the ancient hominins                The dark skin in modern humans was established around 1.2 million years ago, driven by the loss of body hair after divergence from apes, presumably to protect against UV-induced damages [13, 93–96]. Then, when did modern Eurasians start to depigment? The studies on skin color adaptation summarized above are based on modern population genetic data, which may suffer from limited temporal resolution caused by the population demographic history, and insensitivity to selection acting on standing variations [97]. The advent of ancient DNA analyses makes it possible to directly observe the evolution processes, and thus would facilitate our understanding of this key question.                A study on the genomes of Anatolian Neolithic farmers in West Eurasia (6500–300 BC), who are probably the source population of the first European farmers, suggests that the light skin color has been evolved since at least 6500–4000 years ago [98]. Several popular genes identified in modern Eurasians, e.g., SLC45A2, GRM5 and HERC2/OCA2 showed strong signal of selection in these ancient samples. This conclusion is supported by another study based on the Eneolithic (6500–5000 BP) and Bronze Age (5000–4000 BP) samples, representing the early European farmers or late hunter-gatherers in central Europe [99]. One possible motivation of the skin depigmentation in prehistoric Eurasia is agriculturalization, which led to a switch from vitamin D-rich hunter-gatherer diet to a vitamin D-poor agriculturalist diet, together with the increased danger of folic acid deficiency at higher latitudes [14, 100]. Moreover, the selective pressures have kept operating for a long time after they initiated the adaptation of skin color, as some ancestral pigmentations alleles were identified in a Mesolithic European (7000 BP), and some adaptive alleles under selection in the ancient Eurasians are still evolving in modern humans [98, 99, 101].                Recent studies on archaic hominins (e.g., Neanderthals, an extinct hominid group living in Eurasia ~400,000–28,000 years ago [102]) further improved our understanding of skin color evolution in modern humans. Neanderthals met modern humans in the Middle East ~60,000–50,000 years ago, and contributed to about 1–4% of modern human genomes [103–105]. Some pigmentation-associated genes are identified in the introgressed haplotypes from Neanderthals in modern Eurasians, such as POU2F3, BNC2 and MC1R [106, 107]. Specifically, the introgressive alleles were reported to result in light skin color, suggesting an ‘adaptive introgression’ strategy of human skin color adaptation. Other introgressive genes related to skin phenotypes include HYAL genes, which are associated with cellular responses to UV and are under strong positive selection in East Asians [108], and those involved in keratin filaments formation [109]. Although these genes are not direct determinants of skin pigmentation, they, like those pigmentation-related genes, possibly helped modern humans adapt to non-African environments.                When drawing conclusions of adaptive introgression, we are actually claiming that Neanderthals could be light-complexioned. This inference is just based on some pigmentation-associated genes or alleles identified in existing modern human populations, since visible phenotypes of Neanderthals and other extinct species are not available. However, when using some other priory genes as potential clues, different results can be obtained. For instance, the derived state of MC1R, which is responsible for pale skin, presents in Neanderthal individuals from Italy and Spain but is missing in Croatian Neanderthals and Denisova [110], suggesting skin color variation in the archaic hominins. In addition, the light skin in Neanderthals and modern Eurasians could also result from convergent evolution, rather than adaptive introgression [111].                The hypothesis of adaptive introgression seems to predate when modern human became pale – long before the late Mesolithic age, as Neanderthals went extinct around 28,000 years ago. However, we should reconsider whether the genes affecting skin color in archaic hominins indeed determined skin color in modern humans. Even if this is the case, it is also possible that modern human retained these introgressive variants until they showed some phenotypic effects under some specific strong selective pressures. Thus, more data resources and analyses are necessary to address this issue in the future.              Selection coefficient and effect size                As one of the most obvious changes in the environment after modern human migrated out of Africa to higher latitudes, UV has exerted considerable selective pressures on human skin pigmentation, which can be reflected by selection coefficients of the pigmentation-related genes. The estimation of selection coefficients largely depends on the genes considered and the methodologies. Beleza et al. estimated the coefficient of selection at several loci representing SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TYRP1, and KITLG [61]. For example, the estimates are 0.05/0.04 for SLC45A2 and 0.16/0.08 for SLC24A5 under a dominant/an additive model of inheritance in Europeans. Meanwhile, López et al. reported the selection coefficient of a variant in SLC45A2 to be 0.01–0.02 in a South European populations [112]. These estimations are comparable to the selection coefficients inferred directly from serially sampled data at HERC2, SLC45A2, and TYR, ranging from 0.02–0.1 [99]. The selection coefficients estimated for pigmentation genes are best understood in the context of estimates for other recently selected loci. The selection advantages are inferred to be 0.01–0.08 for LCT, a gene strongly associated with lactase persistence in populations with European ancestry [113, 114], 0.019–0.048 for G6PD, a gene conferring malaria resistance in African populations [115], 0.03–0.19 for EDAR associated with the increased scalp hair thickness and changed tooth morphology in the Han Chinese [116], and 0.0004–0.0023 for EGLN1 and EPAS1 gene regions contributing to the high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans [117]. The selection coefficients for pigmentation genes are among the most strongly selected genes in the human genome, indicating a severe selective pressure caused by UV or some other environmental changes in non-African regions.                Although a large number of genes have been identified to contribute to skin color variation, how much could they explain the skin color variation in modern humans? Is there a gene or variant that has a dominant effect on the skin color? Some genes could possibly play a major role in determining skin color in specific populations. For instance, the light skin variant at rs1426654 in SLC24A5 could explain 22–32% of the variance of the melanin index in South Asian [75] and 25–38% in African-American and African-Caribbean populations [118]. Additionally, the derived allele at rs642742 in KITLG may account for lightening of a person’s skin by 6 to 7 melanin units, nearly 1/5 of the overall skin reflectance difference between West Africans and Europeans (30 melanin units) [56]. However, there are relatively more genes and variants with smaller effects. One of the key variants in OCA2, rs1800414, could explain around 4% of the pigmentation variation in East Asian populations [47]. In South Asians, rs16891982 in SLC45A2 and rs1042602 in TYR account for 3.6% and 2.5% skin color variation, respectively, much less than the effect size of rs1426654 in SLC24A5 [74]. The inheritance mode of skin pigmentation follows an additive model, or at least an incomplete additive model [16, 17, 47, 56, 75].              ConclusionsOverall, human skin color is a highly variable and complex trait as a consequence of strong selection pressure and is controlled by multiple genetic loci (summarized in Table 1). Skin color adaptation is a complex process because different populations have shared and independent genetic mechanisms involving a large number of genes with different effect advantages on the phenotype. Skin color adaptation is also a long evolutionary process influenced by various historical, even pre-historical, population genetic events. Current studies provide comprehensive insights into the natural selection process and mechanisms of human skin color variation. A richer resource of high-coverage whole-genome sequences and phenotype data may provide opportunities to further speculate an accurate model of genetic architecture and gene-environment effects, and advance our understanding of skin pigmentation in certain minor ethnic groups, such as hunter-gatherers and highlanders. We believe that these studies may greatly enrich our knowledge of human evolution history and elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits in humans.Table 1                    A summary of candidate

KeywordsHan ChineseJapaneseKoreanGenetic ancestryPopulation structurePopulation divergenceAdmixtureSNPBackgroundEast Asia is one of the worldâ<U+0080><U+0099>s most populated places, consisting of about 38% of the Asian population or about 22% of the world-wide population. East Asian peoples, especially the three major ethnicities, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean, share many similarities in characteristics, for example, yellow skin, black eyes and black hair, short and flat noses, which make them hard to be distinguished by appearance. Moreover, East Asian people use similar languages and words, for example, Chinese characters are shared in Japanese, and also existed in Korean until their recent abolition in the 1940s [1].While many studies have reported the overall picture of genetic structure of global populations, finer scale details of population structure and relevant issues in East Asia have not yet been well addressed. In fact, in many previous studies, samples of Han Chinese and Japanese populations were generally treated as a single group [2], and notably, Korean samples are frequently absent from many important international collaborative projects due to their assumed similarity to Han Chinese and Japanese samples, such as the International HapMap Project [3] and the 1000 Genomes Project [4]. A recent study [5] provided a landscape of autosomal variation and an overall picture of the genetic relationship of Asian populations. However, fine scale genetic structure and relationship among Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations have not been revealed or well-studied, partially due to low density of the data.Here, we newly genotyped 100 Korean samples, and conducted a joint population genetic analysis with 182 Han Chinese individuals and 90 Japanese individuals. We attempted to address some fundamental questions related to the population histories of the three ethnic groups. First, we asked what the genetic make-up of the three populations is and how well they are differentiated. Second, we attempted to dissect population history of the three ethnic groups and infer their genetic origins based on state-of-art methods developed recently. Finally, we asked whether there were subsequent gene-flow occurred since population splits. We believe these efforts can advance our understanding of human genetic diversity and migration history in East Asia, and provide insightful information for future medical studies in the three East Asian populations.ResultsPopulation structure and genetic relationship                Genetic difference measured by FST                  To assess the genetic relationship among East Asian groups, we examined genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in 1032 individuals representing 12 populations. We first calculated pairwise FST based on genome-wide SNPs (Additional file 1: Figure S1, Additional file 2: Table S2). The three smallest FST values are between north Han Chinese (CHB) and south Han Chinese (CHS) (FST[CHB-CHS]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0014), between Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna (CDX) and Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam (KHV) (FST[CDX-KHV]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0024), and between CHB and Korean (KOR) (FST[CHB-KOR]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0026). Genetic difference between KOR and Japanese (JPT) (FST[JPT-KOR]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0033) is larger than that between KOR and CHB, but smaller than that between two Mongolian populations (Buryat Mongolian (BMON) and DU Mongolian in Qinghai (QHM) [6], FST[BMON-QHM]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0053). These results are largely consistent with the geographic distribution of populations. Generally, pairwise FST between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean (0.0026~â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0090) are greater than that within Han Chinese (0.0014), but are much smaller than that between European (CEU) and any East Asian groups, for example, the smallest FST between CEU and East Asian populations (FST[CEU-BMON]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0838; FST[CEU-KHV]â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.1059) are higher by an order of magnitude. These results suggested a comparatively closer relationship between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean. More detailed information about the populations can be found in Additional file 3: Table S1.                Phylogenetic trees of populations and individuals                  A maximum likelihood (ML) tree reconstructed based on pairwise allele frequency difference provides a better visualization of the genetic relationship of populations (Fig. 2a). All the East Asian populations share a clade, and Mongolians are much closer to European than any other East Asian groups. Among the eight non-Mongolian East Asian populations, the Tibetan population (TIB) shows apparent differentiation from the other seven populations which are comprised of four typical mainland populations (CDX, CHB, CHS and KHV) and three island or peninsula populations (JPRK, JPT and KOR).                  An individual level neighbor-joining (NJ) tree of 1002 world-wide individuals based on genotyping differentiation was also constructed (Additional file 4: Figure S2A). African and European individuals cluster together respectively, and East Asians individuals also have their own distinct cluster. In East Asians individuals, Mongolian, Ryukyuan and Tibetan have relatively distinct cluster, while Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean showed a relatively mixed phylogeny, suggest their much closer relationship, although substructures are also apparent. Han Chinese samples also show mixture with Southern populations (CDX and KHV).                  Using only 6 populations (two Han Chinese populations, Japanese, Korean and two Mongolian populations) to reconstruct an individual tree, we found the phylogeny of the populations became clearer (Additional file 4: Figure S2B). Japanese individuals have their own cluster and Korean individuals are almost distinct from Han Chinese. North and South Han Chinese mixed together, but still have some substructure.                Principal component analysis                  We further performed principal components analysis (PCA) to examine the population structure on individual level (Figs. 1b, 2b, and Additional file 5: Figure S3). We first analyzed East Asian populations with populations worldwide based on 9063 genome-wide SNPs with inter-marker distance >â<U+0080><U+0089>500 kb (see Methods) (Additional file 5: Figure S3A). The first principal component (PC1) and the second principal component (PC2) explain 9.2 and 4.4% of the total variance (or 58.0% and 28.0% of the top ten PCs), respectively. East Asian groups cluster together closely and are located far from European or African in the PC plot, consistent with their differentiation from other continental populations. We observed some individuals, most of which are Mongolian individuals (BMON or QHM), extend towards CEU cluster, suggesting recent gene flow might have occurred between European and Mongolian populations. Analysis of a dataset with higher density markers (44,549 SNPs, after excluding JPRK samples due to lower marker density, Additional file 5: Figure S3B) showed similar pattern except that individuals were more tightly clustered (PC1 and PC2 explained 10.2% and 4.7% of the variance respectively).

And the marked number are bootstrap value; (B) The top two PCs of individuals representing six East Asian populations, mapped to their corresponding geographic locations (generated by R 2.15.2 and Microsoft Excel 2010)                                          Although East Asian individuals cluster very tightly in the context of analysis of worldwide populations, PCA of ten East Asian populations showed they have substantial substructure (Fig. 1b). For example, Han Chinese (CHB and CHS) and southern populations (CDX and KHV) were separated from other populations by PC1. According to coordinate of PC2 which explained 0.7% of the total variance, Mongolian and Tibetan are closely located in one side, while the island populations (Japanese and Ryukyuan) other side. Except Mongolian and Tibetan, other populations showed much closer relationship in the PC plot (Fig. 1b, Additional file 5: Figure S3C). Some Tibetan and DU Mongolian (QHM) individuals distribute toward CHB cluster, suggesting gene flow between these northern populations. These patterns are even more obvious when JPRK samples were removed from the analysis (Additional file 5: Figure S3C). High density dataset showed more pronounced substructure: On a finer scale, two Mongolian populations also showed substructure, and QHM individuals are sitting between BMON and TIB clusters which is consistent with their history [6]. In all the analyses, Dai (CDX) and Vietnamese (KHV) always cluster closely and can be separated from Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean (Fig. 1b, Additional file 5: Figure S3C).                  To examine genetic relationship of the typical East Asian populations, we did a separate PCA with some southern populations excluded (Fig. 2b). PC1 separates Mongolian from the other groups and explain 0.9% of the variance (or 21.9% of the top 10 PCs). PC2 separates populations living in the islands and peninsula from the mainland populations. Japanese and Korean each has each independent cluster, while two Han Chinese populations and two Mongolian both have some overlaps, and some Mongolian individuals are located toward CHB. Interestingly, the distribution of these clusters is generally consistent with the geographical distribution of these populations (Fig. 2b). We next performed PCA of only Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean individuals (Additional file 5: Figure S3D), PC1 explained 0.8% of the variance (or 20.2% of the top 10 PCs) and separated Han Chinese from Japanese and Korean. PC2 separated CHB and KOR from CHS and JPT. Japanese and Korean each has its own cluster and both are located apart from Han Chinese while CHB and CHS cannot be completely separated at this scale. These results suggested that although similar in appearance, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean are different in terms of genetic make-up, and the difference among the three groups are much larger than that between northern and southern Han Chinese.                K-mean clustering analysis                  We classified Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean individuals by K-means clustering with first 10 PCs (Additional file 6: Figure S4). Assuming three clusters (Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>3), Han Chinese and Korean are not well distinguished, while all the Japanese individuals cluster perfectly. There are two clusters in Han Chinese and Korean, the north cluster (NC, in orange) and the south cluster (SC, in green). All the Korean individuals belong to NC while CHB and CHS have SC on average of  7.5% and 67.4% of SC, respectively. Assuming four clusters (Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>4), Han Chinese can be distinguished well from Korean. The NC at Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>3 separated into Korean cluster (KC, in blue) and north Han Chinese cluster (NHC, in orange) [7]. Around 64.0% of CHB individuals and 9.0% of KOR individuals are assigned to NHC, while 3.4 and 32.6% of CHB individuals to KC and SC (in green), respectively.                Screen ancestry informative markers                  We further explored whether the three populations could be well distinguished with a small number of ancestry informative markers (AIMs, see Methods). Individuals from any two populations can be distinguished with a sufficient number of AIMs, and we use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC, see Methods) to measure the clustering ability of AIMs (Additional file 7: Figure S5). As a result, we could use only 89 SNPs (CHB/KOR), 46 SNPs (CHB/JPT), 44 SNPs (CHS/KOR), 26 SNPs (CHS/JPT) and 73 SNPs (JPT/KOR) respectively to perfectly distinguish each population pairs. These AIMs can facilitate discerning and controlling of population structure among major East Asian populations in future association studies [8].                Origins, divergence time and migration history of Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean                To reveal the population history of the three East Asian ethnic groups, we conducted a series of population genetic analysis and estimation. We first estimated the effective population size (Ne) [9] of East Asian and worldwide populations from 5 to 250 thousand years ago (KYA), assuming 25 years per generation [9] (Fig. 3, Additional file 8: Figure S6). Our analysis showed that African population (YRI) had the greatest Ne before 500 generations ago (GA), and Ne of European (CEU) was also greater than those of most East Asian populations (except for CDX and KHV) before 1000 GA. However, East Asian populations all showed strong recent growth (~â<U+0080><U+0089>1% per generation during the recent 500 generations), so that Ne of most East Asian populations exceeded that of YRI during the recent ~â<U+0080><U+0089>12.5 KYA. In East Asia, CDX and KHV have the greatest Ne, followed by CHB. Tibetan (TIB) and Mongolian (BMON and QHM) have greater Ne than CHS and KOR before 500 GA, but grew slower than the later ones in recent 7500 years. Because of low marker density of the data, the estimation of Ne of JPRK might not be accurate, but apparently Ne of JPRK was the smallest. Korean roughly has the same Ne with Japanese and two Mongolian populations in history, but showed greater increasing rate in recent 12,500 years.                                          Fig. 3                        Effective population size varied along time. Effective population size (Ne) was calculated from LD observations in 2500 distance classes (from 0.001 cM to 2.5 cM with the window size set as 0.001 cM) for each population. Results from 2000 generations ago (GA) to 200 GA are shown (generated by Microsoft Office 365)                                      We further estimated divergence time (TF) of each population pair (Tables 1 and 2) based on FST (Additional file 2: Table S2) and Ne following the formula TFâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2NeFST (1) [9]. Most non-African populations diverged from African ~â<U+0080><U+0089>82 KYA, consistent with the time of â<U+0080><U+009C>Out of Africaâ<U+0080> as suggested by mtDNA studies [9]. European and East Asian populations diverged later than that between African and non-African populations. Among East Asian populations, CDX diverged from CEU ~â<U+0080><U+0089>56 KYA, while the other East Asian populations separated from European about 35~â<U+0080><U+0089>50 KYA.Table 1                        Pairwise divergence time (TF)                      TF(GA)BMONCDXCEUCHBCHSJPRKJPTKHVKORQHMTIBYRIBMON06031399276315321265478238882843796CDX603022562181184823746032015275094518CEU139922560183916901369167619851782189615893290CHB27621818390242381221494711261993948CHS3151181690240238144738110592363682JPRK32148213692382380793791798943293156JPT26537416761221447902855410302793685KHV47860198514973379285023513474094172KOR2383201782478117954235010502253826QHM88152718961126105989410301347105009983988TIB284509158919923632927940922599803592YRI379645183290394836823156368541723826398835920                      Note: Pairwise divergence time (TF), in units of generations ago (GA), estimated by 2NeFST                    Table 2                        Results of F4 test                      popOpopApopBpopCF4(A,O;C,B)F4(B,O;C,A)YRITIBCDXCHB0.012550.01977YRITIBCDXCHS0.010190.02478YRITIBCDXKOR0.013330.01780CEUTIBCDXCHB0.010630.02007CEUTIBCDXCHS0.009570.02605CEUTIBCDXKOR0.012380.01917YRICDXJPRKCHB0.013170.00911YRICDXJPRKCHS0.018180.00843YRICDXJPRKJPT0.007230.02230YRICDXJPRKKOR0.011190.01547CEUCDXJPRKCHB0.012390.00734CEUCDXJPRKCHS0.018380.00788CEUCDXJPRKJPT0.007280.02052CEUCDXJPRKKOR0.011500.01442YRITIBJPRKJPT0.007660.02798YRITIBJPRKKOR0.012410.02116CEUTIBJPRKJPT0.007690.02849CEUTIBJPRKKOR0.012670.02239                      Note: population A (popA) and population B (popB) are two donate populations, population C (popC) is a target population who received gene flow, population O (popO) is an out group. Additional file 14: Figure S10C shows the model of F4 test. The value of F4(A,O;C,B) stands for the size of the common part of the two pathway A to O and C to B (labeled as l) on the tree weighted by the gene flow proportion Î± (labeled as Î±l), and similarly F4(B,O;C,A) equals (1-Î±)m. And the calculation of F4 value noted in METHODS                                    We found that the present-day Han Chinese and Japanese have the most recent common ancestor that can be dated back about 3.0~â<U+0080><U+0089>3.6 KYA (corresponding to the Shang Dynasty in Chinese history). Korean and northern Han Chinese had frequent communications in ancient time, and the divergence time between the two populations was estimated as ~â<U+0080><U+0089>1.2 KYA (corresponding to the later period of Three Kingdoms of Korea, or the Tang Dynasty in China). And Japanese and Korean separated ~â<U+0080><U+0089>1.4 KYA, a little earlier than that of Han Chinese and Korean (corresponding to Asuka period in Japan, or in the middle of Three Kingdoms period of Korea).              Gene flow among east Asian populations                Considering their frequent communication in history, we are curious about how the initial common origin and recent gene flow contributed to the genetic make-up of Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations.                STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE analysis                  To examine fine-scale population structure and assess the genetic make-up of East Asian groups, we applied a model-based method, STRUCTURE [10], to analyze the genome-wide data with that of worldwide populations. East Asian populations showed distinct genetic component inferred from STRUCTURE which is totally different from those of European or African (Additional file 9: Figure S7). There is no more than 0.5% of Africanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s contribution in East Asianâ<U+0080><U+0099>s genome can be detected, while in Mongolian there is considerable contribution from European ancestry (12.5~â<U+0080><U+0089>16.9%) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>3). We identified a component which we named northern East Asian component (NEAC) existing widely in the East Asian populations (Additional file 9: Figure S7, in red). On the contrary, southern East Asian component (SEAC) exists mainly in typical mainland populations (CDX, CHB, CHS and KHV) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, in green), and Ryukyuan component (RC) exists mainly in island and peninsula populations (JPRK, JPT and KOR) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>5~â<U+0080><U+0089>7, in yellow). QHM has some Tibetan component (TC) (~â<U+0080><U+0089>8.98%) while BMON has very limited TC (~â<U+0080><U+0089>0.5%) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>7, in purple). We could also observe considerable TC contribution in CHB and JPRK (5.2 and 2.6%, respectively) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>7, in purple).                  To further assess finer scale population structure and genetic composition of East Asian populations, we run independent STRUCTURE analyses in the ten East Asian populations without non-Asian population samples (Additional file 10: Figure S8). At Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>3, we observed a clear north/south cline of genetic components. SEAC (in green) constituted the majority (92.7%) of the CDX genome; Mongolian and Tibetan showed distinct composition but both were influenced by NEAC significantly (5.7%~â<U+0080><U+0089>15.0%) (Additional file 10: Figure S8, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>4, in red). At Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>5, Mongolian had different composition from Tibetan but showed considerable contribution from the Tibetan component (TC) (3.1~â<U+0080><U+0089>14.5%), especially in QHM, who migrated to Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau about 500 years ago and were reported to have adapted to local environment [6]. TC was also observed widely in other populations such as Han Chinese and Korean (2.3~â<U+0080><U+0089>12.6%) (Additional file 10: Figure S8, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>5, in purple). At Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>6, RC was separated into two different components, one (in pink) mainly exists in island populations (JPT and JPRK) and has very little (1.4~â<U+0080><U+0089>1.7%) contribution to other populations, and the other (in yellow) exists both in island populations (JPRK and JPT, 39.1~â<U+0080><U+0089>66.7%) and northern populations (BMON, CHB and KOR, 4.3~â<U+0080><U+0089>41.7%) (Additional file 10: Figure S8, Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>6).                  We confirmed the ancestry inference results with another commonly used method, ADMIXTURE [11] (Fig. 4). We ran ADMIXTURE from Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2 to Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>12 and chose results at Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>5 as the best inference according to ADMIXTUREâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cross-validation procedure (the best K has the lowest cross-validation error) (Additional file 11: Figure S9). Similar to the STRUCTURE results, East Asian individuals demonstrated three typical ancestry components which were entirely different from African or European. No strong influence of African ancestry on East Asian populations was detected (3.1% in TIB and no more than 2.4% in any other East Asian populations). However, we observed considerable presence of European ancestry in Mongolian population (15.5~â<U+0080><U+0089>16.1%) and some other East Asian populations (up to 6.4%). As shown in Fig. 4, the three dominant ancestral components in East Asian populations are NEAC (in red), SEAC (in green) and RC (in yellow). NEAC is also dominant in Tibetan and Mongolian and uniformly distributes in Han Chinese (27.3 to 39.4%), Japanese (24.5%) and Korean (39.9%). SEAC and RC are frequent in CDX/KHV and JPRK respectively, and both exist in other East Asian populations, while their proportions are generally negatively correlated across populations.                                              Fig. 4                          Admixture analysis of East Asian populations together with world-wide non-Asian populations. Result of Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>5 was shown and each vertical bar represents genome makeup of an sample individual (calculated by ADMIXTURE 1.23 [1] and R 2.15.2)                                        F test and D test                  We used the F3 test [12, 13] to detect potential admixture populations and a significant negative F3 value suggests existence of gene flow and possible admixture pattern. We tried each populations combination (F3 (population C; population A, population B)) and listed those with negative F3 values (Additional file 12: Table S3). We found that to some degree Han Chinese, Japanese, Korean populations each received gene flow from the other two. According to the F3 results, Han Chinese may have common origin with CDX and KHV, and receive gene flow from northern groups (NEAC) and from islands groups (RC). Japanese has significant JPRK contribution and can be treated as an admixture of Ryukyuan and other East Asian populations (Additional file 12: Table S3). The Korean population also has NEAC, SEAC and RC, but F3 results strongly suggest that it received gene flow directly through Han Chinese and Japanese (Additional file 12: Table S3). Our results showed that Mongolian populations (BMON and QHM) were admixed by European and some East Asian populations (for example, Han Chinese or Japanese, or their common ancestry, Additional file 12: Table S3), consistent with their known history.                  We further performed F4 test [12, 13] to quantitatively estimate the gene flow from surrounding groups to Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations, respectively. F4(A, B; C, D) denotes the common part of two drift route A to B and C to D (Additional file 13: Figure S11C). If A and B are two reference populations, C is a target population and O is the outgroup, then F4(O, A; B, C) and F4(O, B; A, C) have linear relation, which is equal to the gene flow ratio multiplied by common drift route (Î±l and (1-Î±)m, Additional file 13: Figure S11C). Therefore, we can use linear regression method to estimate the gene flow (Additional file 14: Figure S10). As a result, NEAC contributed 52.2% to CHB, 44.0% to CHS, 19.7% to JPT and 37.5% to KOR; RC contributed 14.3% to CHB, 12.4% to CHS, 52.6% to JPT and 33.8% to KOR; SEAC contributed 33.5% to CHB, 43.6% to CHS, 27.7% to JPT and 28.7% to KOR.                  Finally, we applied the D test (4 population test) [12] to qualitatively estimate the gene flow Between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations (Table 3). In D test, a significant nonzero D values suggest the existence of gene flow (Additional file 13: Figure S11, more information can be found in Material and Methods part). Significant negative values were observed when D test were applied for comparing gene flow between Han Chinese and Japanese/Korean, indicating greater gene flow between Han Chinese and Korean than that between Han Chinese and Japanese. We further applied D test for detecting gene flow between Japanese/Korean and south/north Han Chinese, the D values were not significantly different from 0, indicating the gene flow between north Han Chinese and Japanese/Korean are almost equal to that between south Han Chinese and Japanese/Korean. These results remain consistent when different outgroups (CEU, YRI) were used in the analysis (Table 3).Table 3                          Results of D test                        popWpopApopYpopZD valueZ scoreCHBYRIJPTKORâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0055â<U+0088><U+0092>5.061CHSYRIJPTKORâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0054â<U+0088><U+0092>4.865JPTYRICHBCHS0.00141.515KORYRICHBCHS0.00161.649CHBCEUJPTKORâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0062â<U+0088><U+0092>6.748CHSCEUJPTKORâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0060â<U+0088><U+0092>6.596JPTCEUCHBCHSâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0005â<U+0088><U+0092>0.595KORCEUCHBCHSâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0004â<U+0088><U+0092>0.446                        Note: Population A (popA) is outgroup, population W (popW) is a reference population, population Y (popY) and population Z (popZ) are two potential target populations.

Our results showed that the three East Asian populations, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although they resemble each other in appearance, have distinguishing genetic make-up and are differentiated apparently on genomic level. In this respect, we suggest the three East Asian ethnic groups should be treated as independent populations in the future studies rather than as a single group, particularly in evolutionary studies or medical studies where population structure matters. In addition to global differentiation, the AIMs we screened also indicated considerable differentiation of local genomic regions among the three populations. For example, several highly differentiated SNPs (AIMs) are enriched in the CD46 gene (on chromosome 1q32), which is a type I membrane protein and is a regulatory part of the complement system [14, 15]. These highly differentiated genomic regions could be due to regional adaptation to some pathogens, although further studies are necessary to validate these signals and confirm this conclusion. These results further suggest the importance to consider population difference when medical studies are conducted in the three East Asian ethnic groups.It is obvious that the genetic difference among the three East Asian groups initially resulted from population divergence due to pre-historical or historical migrations. Subsequently, different geographical locations where the three populations are located, mainland of China, Korean Peninsular and Japanese archipelago, respectively, apparently facilitated population differentiation due to physical isolation and independent genetic drift. Our estimations of population divergence time among the three groups, 1.2~â<U+0080><U+0089>3.6 KYA, are largely consistent with known history of the three populations and those related. However, considering that recent admixture could have reduced genetic difference between populations, it is likely the divergence time was underestimated.We detected substantial gene flow among the three populations and also from the surrounding populations. For example, based on our analysis with the F3 test, Korean received gene flow from Han Chinese and Japanese, and gene flow also happened between Han Chinese and Japanese (Additional file 12: Table S3). These gene flows are expected to have reduced the genetic differentiation between the three ethnic groups. On the other hand, we also detected considerable gene flow from surrounding populations to the three populations studied. For instance, an ancestral population represented by Ryukyuan have contributed greater to Japanese than to Han Chinese, while southern ethnic group like Dai have contributed more to continent populations than to island and peninsula populations. Contrary to the gene flow among the three populations, these gene flows from surrounding populations are expected to have increased genetic difference among the three populations if they occurred independently and from different source populations. According to our results, the major source of gene flow to the three ethnic groups were substantially different, for example, the major source of gene flow to Han Chinese was from southern ethnic groups, the major source of gene flow to Japanese was from southern islands, and the major source of gene flow to Korean were from both mainland and islands. Therefore, those gene flows might have significantly contributed to further genetic differentiation of the three populations.The three populations have similar but not identical demographical history; they all experience a strong population expansion in the last 20,000 years. However, according to different geographic distribution, their effective population size and population expansion are different. North Han Chinese has greater Ne than south Han Chinese in early time. Japanese and Korean have similar Ne in most of the history, while Korean population expanded much faster than Japanese in recent thousands of years, suggested a higher potential for population expansion in peninsula than in islands. Our estimation showed that Han Chinese have much greater expansion speed than Japanese and Korean, suggested continental environment has even higher potential for population expansion than peninsula or islands. However, the estimated Ne increase in East Asian populations could be, at least partially, explained by recent population admixture which is expected to increase population genetic diversity thus increase Ne.Finally, as we briefly mentioned above, natural selection might have substantially contributed to the genetic diversity of the populations. We identified several genomic regions with significant differentiation between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean. For example, most highly differentiated SNPs enriched in the genes that related to neurological system process and cell-cell signal transmission. There are also significant selective signals in detected in EGF-like domain and Collagen-like domain. The physiological significance and evolutionary importance of these selective signals needed more study.ConclusionIn summary, the genetic structures of the present-day Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean people were shaped jointly by initial population divergence, geographical isolation, subsequent gene flow and possibly regional natural selection. Our analysis of the genome-wide data of these populations and their surrounding neighbors should advance our understanding of population history and mechanism of human genetic diversity in East Asia.MethodsPopulation and samples                Peripheral blood samples of 100 Koreans unrelated individuals were collected from South Korea. Each individual was the offspring of a non-consanguineous marriage of members of the same nationality within three generations. Informed consents were acquired from the participants. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Responsible Committee on Human Experimentation (approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, No. ER-SIBS-261408) and the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. In addition, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data of 182 unrelated Han Chinese, and 90 Japanese individuals were collected from the HapMap Project (International HapMap, 2003) and the 1000 Genomes Project [4], and comparisons were made with 663 individuals (630 individuals through Quality Control) representing 8 populations worldwide from the HapMap Project, the 1000 Genomes Project and the PanAsia SNP Project [5] (Fig. 1a, Additional file 3: Table S1).              Genotyping and data quality control                A set of 934,968 loci were genotyped in 100 Korean samples with Affymetrix Genome-wide human SNP Array 6.0. *.CEL files containing raw intensity data were analyzed with Birdsuite version 1.5.3 [16]. Only autosomal SNPs with missing rate less than 0.05 were employed for the downstream analyses. For the purposes of this study, only SNPs with Reference Sequence (RS) numbers and vendor-specified strands were used in combining data. For different purposes of analysis, several combined data sets were generated. The first two data sets (dataset 1 and dataset 2) contains 13,576 SNPs for 1002 individuals from all the twelve populations and 733,113 SNPs for 439 individuals from six East Asia populations (BMON, CHB, CHD, JPT, KOR and QHM). These datasets were used to estimate ASD. And dataset 1 was also prepared for principal component analysis [17], STRUCTURE [10] and Admixture [11] analyses, and estimation of gene flow, so that SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been removed from this data set. The third dataset (dataset 3) contains 44,549 SNPs for 596 individuals representing nine East Asian populations (except JPRK samples), which was used for population structure analyses of East Asian populations only. In the fourth dataset (dataset 4), we kept all the SNPs genotyped in all the samples respectively, and used for estimating FST and screening AIMs [8]. The last dataset (dataset 5) was based on the dataset 4 but phased particularly for calculating LD.                To control for potential batch effect during our data integration, we corrected allele frequency of BMON and QHM [6] by comparing genotypes of the identical CHB and JPT individuals between the data set of [6] and our own data. Because CHB and JPT were also included in the same data set together with BMON and QHM in [6]. To avoid any possible systematic bias introduced during data integration, we did SNP re-calling for HapMap individuals from raw Affymetrix intensity data (.CEL files).              Population structure analysis                Genetic difference between populations was measured by FST which was calculated following an unbiased estimate [18]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed at individual level using EIGENSOFT [17]. The map was drawn by R (version 2.15.2) based on the information provided by http://www.mapsofworld.com/. We used an allele sharing distance (ASD) as a measure of genetic distance between individuals, and a 1002â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>1002 and a 439â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>439 inter-individual genetic distance matrixes were generated according to genotypes of 13,576 and 733,113 autosomal SNPs respectively (dataset 1&2). The tree of individuals was reconstructed based on ASD distance and using Neighbor-Joining algorithm [19] with the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software package (MEGA version 4.0) [20]. Trees of populations as well as components were reconstructed using maximum likelihood method [21] with CONTML program in PHYLIP package (version 3.695) [22]. K-mean clustering analysis was done with R software. Ancestry of each person was inferred using a Bayesian cluster analysis as implemented in the STRUCTURE program [23, 10]. We ran STRUCTURE from Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2 to Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>7 and repeated 5 times for each single K. All STRUCTURE runs used 15,000 iterations after a burn-in of length 15,000, with the admixture model and assuming that allele frequencies were correlated [23]. Admixture [11] was also employed for the same purpose.                We screened Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) [8] to distinguish Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean. These AIMs were selected by the following three criteria: 1) allele frequency highly differentiated between each two populations (measured by FST); 2) inter-marker distance larger than 500 Kb; 3) Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of a panel of AIMs based on PC1 not less than 1.0. MCC is defined as the follows:$$ \mathrm{MCC}=\frac{TP\times TN- FP\times FN}{\sqrt{\left( TP+ FP\right)\left( TP+ FN\right)\left( TN+ FP\right)\left( TN+ FN\right)}} $$ (5)where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives and FN is the number of false negatives [8]).              Estimation of effective population size and divergence time                We first phased the genotype data with BEAGLE [24]. In order to improve the accuracy of the haplotype inference (phasing), we combined those datasets from the same source and did further estimation independently.                Then we calculated pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) of each SNPs pair with genetic distance less than 0.25 cM in each population. And effective population size (Ne) of t generations ago (tâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1/2c (2) [9]) can be estimated for each population in each distance category as Neâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1/(4c)*[(1/rLD2)-2] (3) [9], where c is the genetic distance. All rLD2 are adjust as (rLD2â<U+0080><U+0093>1/n), where n is sample size (number of chromosomes) [9]. Divergence time (TF) can be estimated by 2NeFST (4) [9]. Here, FST values were still calculated following an unbiased estimate. Ne was calculated as the average of the harmonic means of the relevant recombination distance categories. We used distances categories 0.01 cM to 0.25 cM (corresponding to 200 to 5000 generations ago) to estimate inter-population Ne [9].              Gene flow estimation                We used D test and F test to detect and estimate gene flow [12]. All the variations and Z scores are calculated by delete-m jackknife [25].                In D test, D value indicates the difference of the two allele patterns ABBA and BABA (Additional file 13: Figure S11A). A significant positive or negative D value (|Z|â<U+0080><U+0089>>â<U+0080><U+0089>2.58, pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) suggests the existence of gene flow either from W to Y or from W to Z. X is out group. In population genetics, D is calculated by$$ \widehat{N}{um}_i/\widehat{D}{en}_i $$ (6)                where$$ \widehat{N}{um}_i=\left(w-x\right)\left(y-z\right) $$ (7)$$ \widehat{D}{en}_i=\left(w+x-2 wx\right)\left(y+z-2 yz\right) $$ (8)                w, y, x and z are sample allele frequency of population W, Y, X, Z.                In F test, F2 value is calculated by$$ {F}_2\left(A,B\right)=E\left[{\left({a}^{\hbox{'}}-{b}^{\hbox{'}}\right)}^2\right] $$ (9)                (a and b are sample allele frequency of population A and B) and can be looked as the drift on edge A to B in a phylogeny tree. And$$ {F}_3\left(C:A,B\right)=E\left[\left({c}^{\hbox{'}}-{a}^{\hbox{'}}\right)\left({c}^{\hbox{'}}-{b}^{\hbox{'}}\right)\right] $$ (10)denotes the drift on the common path of edge C to A and C to B (Dx, Additional file 13: Figure S11B). If there is no admixture, F3 value should be positive. A significant negative F3 value suggests the existence of gene flow [26, 12, 13]. Similarly,$$ {F}_4\left(A,B:C,D\right)=E\left[\left({a}^{\hbox{'}}-{b}^{\hbox{'}}\right)\left({c}^{\hbox{'}}-{d}^{\hbox{'}}\right)\right] $$ (11)                If there was gene flow in history, the drift from one population to another would go through more than one path in the phylogeny tree; the ratio of drift along each path is decided by the ratio of gene flow. If there were gene flow from population A to population C (with a ratio Î±) and from population B to population C (with a ratio 1-Î±), then$$ {F}_4\left(A,O;C,B\right)=\alpha l $$ (12)$$ {F}_4\left(B,O;C,A\right)=\left(1-\alpha \right)m $$ (13)                Where l and m are unknown, but if there is a series of population C that are admixed with ancestry from both population A and population B (Aâ<U+0080><U+0099> and Bâ<U+0080>²) with different ratio, we can use a linear regression to eliminate these parameters, so that we can calculation each gene flow ratio Î± [13].

KeywordsNotch repressorsHairlessSHARPKyoT2LimpetPrickleGene annotationEvolutionAnimal kingdomBackgroundThe Notch signaling pathway                Multicellular organisms are built by a multitude of cell types that need to be determined and specified in the course of development. This often involves cell to cell communication mediated by the highly conserved Notch signaling pathway. The principal components, the receptor Notch and its ligands - for example Delta -, the signal transducing transcriptional regulator CSL (abbreviated from mammalian CBF1 or RBPJ, Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless and Caenorhabditis Lag1) as well as the HES (Hairy-Enhancer of split) class target-genes, are found in all higher eumetazoan genomes including Hydra vulgaris [1â<U+0080><U+0093>4].                Notch signaling components have been first recognized in Drosophila melanogaster, where mutations in the genes encoding the receptor Notch, the ligands Delta and Serrate, as well as the major antagonist Hairless were identified around 100â<U+0080><U+0089>years ago [5â<U+0080><U+0093>7]. This is not surprising since all these genes are haplo-insufficient, i.e. mutants develop a dominant, name giving phenotype like wing incision, thickened wing veins or loss of mechano-sensory hairs and bristles. First indications that the genes are used in a common developmental process came from the manifold genetic interactions observed in mutant combinations [8]. Later molecular genetic studies revealed the nature of the respective proteins, and allowed to propose their respective roles in Notch signal transduction in flies, and similarly in many other species as well (reviewed in: [1, 2, 9]). In fact, there is a remarkably high conservation of the core components of the Notch signaling pathway in metaozoa throughout the animal kingdom [10].              Activation of Notch signaling                Simplified, Notch signaling activity is triggered by the binding of the membrane tethered ligand on one cell to the receptor Notch of the adjacent cell, resulting in the release of the Notch intra-cellular domain (NICD). NICD itself allows assembly of a transcription activator complex on Notch target gene promoters, together with CSL and the co-activator Mastermind (Mam) (Fig. 1a), as well as additional chromatin activators like histone acetyltransferase (p300, PCAF), histone demethylase (LSD1/CoREST) and histone ubiquitin-ligase (Bre1) (reviewed in: [11â<U+0080><U+0093>13]). CSL contains three conspicuous domains, a N-terminal domain NTD, a beta-trefoil domain BTD, and a C-terminal domain CTD (Fig. 1b). Whereas NTD and BTD make sequence-specific DNA-contacts, NICD contacts both BTD and CTD, the former with the so-called RAM (RBP-JÎº-associated molecule) domain, and the latter with the Ankyrin (ANK) repeats (Fig. 1b) (reviewed in: [11â<U+0080><U+0093>15]).                                          Fig. 1                        Structure of CSL transcription complexes. a) Structure of the human Notch activator complex on DNA (PBD ID: 3v79.1A): CSL (green), Notch 1 ANK-repeats (blue) and the kinked alpha-helical domain of MAML (magenta) (left). Structure prediction of Hydra vulgaris activation complex (right), depicting Notch ANK and CSL, was done by SWISS Model using 3v79.1A as template for human Notch 1 ANK and CSL (center). b) CSL harbors three subdomains, the N-terminal domain NTD, the beta trefoil domain (BTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). NTD and BTD contact the DNA (grey). Left: In the activator complex (C. elegans [PDB ID: 2fo1]) Notch makes contacts to the CTD with the ANK domains (yellow), and to the BTD with its RAM domain (red). Mam (light blue) contacts BTD and ANK. Middle: The CSL-ID of KyoT2 (pink) (PDB-ID: 4J2X) makes very similar contacts as RAM with the BTD. Right: In contrast, contacts between fly Hairless (pink) and Su(H) are restricted to the CTD only (PDB ID: 5E24). c) Sequence comparison of the CSL-interacting domain from KyoT2, RITA and EBNA2 with RAM domains of Notch [Hydra vulgaris (Hv Notch), Homo sapiens (Hs Notch1), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm Notch), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce LIN-12)]. Note lack of the typical Î¦WÎ¦P motif in Hydra Notch (Î¦, any hydrophobic residue). d) Simplified phylogenetic tree of chordates and arthropods. Red: branches with SHARP coding genes, blue: with Hairless coding genes                                      The activation process has been studied experimentally in several organisms, concentrating mostly on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the insect Drosophila melanogaster and several vertebrate species including Danio rerio (zebra fish), clawed frog Xenopus laevis, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens (reviewed in: [16]). Interestingly, the co-activator Mam shows little conservation [17]. Mam is part of the activator complex, contacting CSL and NICD with a bent alpha helix consisting of about 60 residues (Fig. 1a,b). Although Mam proteins are rather large, this alpha helix is the only common character between proteins from fly, worm and mammals (reviewed in: [11, 14, 17]). No sequences encoding a Mam-like protein were identified in the genome of the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris to date, including my own attempts. The few alignments not only lack an alpha helix, but also the conserved residues required for trimeric complex formation [18]. However, a Mam like gene it is present in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa) [10].              Competition for the binding of CSLâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beta trefoil domain                Whereas the principles of Notch target gene activation are well conserved, repression mechanisms are of bewildering variance, and have been primarily studied in mammals and Drosophila. CSL is central to Notch target gene regulation, be it activation or repression. Two principle mechanisms of repression apply (Fig. 1b) (reviewed in: [9, 13, 19]): Firstly, a competition of proteins with NICD for the binding of CSL, thereby decreasing availability of CSL for Notch and hence, activation levels of the target genes. Competition may be direct or indirect as outlined below. Secondly, assembly of a repressor complex on Notch target gene promoters, resulting in silencing of the target genes. Repressor complex formation involves CSL that hence can act as a molecular switch depending on the recruitment of co-activators versus co-repressors [19, 20]. In addition, recruitment of chromatin modifiers, notably histone deacetylases (HDACs, SMRT/Sin3A) and histone chaperones (e.g. Asf1), results in chromatin inactivation (reviewed in: [13]).                The direct competition mechanism appears to be restricted to mammals. It specifically involves the RAM-BTD interaction (Fig. 1b): the RAM domain of NICD, including a tetra-peptide motif Î¦WÎ¦P (Î¦, any hydrophobic residue), makes hydrophobic contacts with a nonpolar pocket of the BTD (reviewed in: [12, 15]) (Fig. 1b, c). Several proteins have been identified to exploit this interaction site, including repressors of Notch activation and the EBNA2 (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2) viral activator hijacking the process [21â<U+0080><U+0093>25]. Structural analyses revealed stunning similarities between RAM and repressor binding; notably the tetra-peptide Î¦WÎ¦P specific contacts are highly conserved (Fig. 1c). Primary examples of CSL-repressor complexes include Mus musculus KyoT2 or Homo sapiens RITA (RBPJ interacting and tubulin associated) (Figs. 1b, c, 2) [19, 24, 25]. RITA is a small, tubulin-associated protein that not only competes with NICD for CSL binding, but results in CSL depletion by its nuclear export [26]. RITA is highly conserved in deuterostomes including Placozoa but, interestingly, not found in insects [26]. Because its evolution has been examined already, it was not included in this study. Despite the in vitro binding of human RITA to Drosophila melanogaster Su(H) and tubulin, no repression of Notch signaling activity was observed in vivo, indicating that this mechanism of Notch regulation does not apply to flies [27]. In contrast to RITA, little is known about the evolution of mouse KyoT2 (Fhl1C in human), one of three splice variants of KyoT (named also Fhl1, four and a half LIM domains). Each LIM domain comprises two tandemly repeated zinc finger domains, separated by a two-amino acid hydrophobic linker, thought to serve protein-protein interactions [28]. The KyoT2 splice variant is smaller, encoding just two and a half LIM domains followed by the CSL interacting domain (CID) encoded by the specific exon [21] (Fig. 2). Apart from the common tetra-peptide Î¦WÎ¦P motif, KyoT2 shares not structural similarity with RITA.

SHARP protein belongs to the Spen protein family; it contains in addition to the RRM and the SPOC domain also a receptor interacting domain (RID), and the RBPJ interacting domain (RBP-ID). c) Mus musculus. KyoT2 is characterized by two complete LIM domains and the CSL interacting domain (CID)                        d) Homo sapiens. RITA protein contains a central RBP interacting domain (RPB-ID) and a Tubulin binding motif at the C-terminus                                    Repressor complex formation on Notch target genes                Repressor complex formation has been investigated both in vertebrates and Drosophila (Fig. 1d). It seems to be the primary mechanism of Notch target gene repression in flies, where it has been studied experimentally in detail. A major antagonist of Notch signaling in Drosophila melanogaster is named Hairless (H), which binds to the fly CSL ortholog Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] (Figs. 1a, 2a). By recruitment of the two general co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), Hairless assembles a repressor complex on Notch-target gene promoters, thereby eventually silencing gene activity [29â<U+0080><U+0093>32] (reviewed in: [9]). The structure of the Su(H)-H repressor complex has been solved recently at the molecular level and confirmed experimentally in vivo [33]. Hairless binds to the CTD of Su(H) in a unconventional way: The Su(H) binding domain of Hairless forms beta-strands that slide deeply into the hydrophobic core of the CTD, distorting the structure in a way that excludes binding of Notch ANK domains [33] (Fig. 1b).                Based on manifold genetic data revealing a quantitative antagonism between Notch and Hairless, a threshold model was postulated with Hairless competing with NICD for Su(H) binding in the cytoplasm [8, 34, 35]. As we know now, both Hairless and NICD bind Su(H) with similar affinities to form transcriptional repressor and activator complexes, respectively [33, 36, 37]. Moreover both, Hairless and NICD, are involved in nuclear shuttling of Su(H) [29, 38â<U+0080><U+0093>41]. Conservation of Hairless has been extensively studied (Fig. 1d): Orthologs are present in all insects studied to date as well as in some members of the subphylum Crustacea [9, 42â<U+0080><U+0093>44]. The D. melanogaster Hairless protein consists of 1077/1059 residues, however, is significantly smaller in more distant species like the honeybee Apis mellifera (392 aa) or the water flea Daphnia pulex (448 aa). Common to all Hairless orthologs is the Su(H) binding domain (SBD), that can be subdivided into a N-terminal NT and a C-terminal CT box, with the former being sufficient for Su(H) contacts (~â<U+0080><U+0089>37 residues). In addition, they all share the Gro binding domain GBD (~â<U+0080><U+0089>9 aa) and the CtBP binding domain CBD (~â<U+0080><U+0089>10 aa), as well as three potential nuclear localization signals (NLS) and one predicted nuclear export signal (NES) [37, 43â<U+0080><U+0093>45]. The three binding domains are well conserved, notably the NT box, which specifies Hairless orthologs (Fig. 2).                Repressor complex formation in Homo sapiens involves SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1 associated repressor protein), also called MINT in Mus musculus (MSX-2 interacting nuclear target), suggested to be the functional homolog of Hairless [46â<U+0080><U+0093>48]. In contrast to the above repressors, SHARP not only binds to the BTD of CSL but also to the CTD, and recruits CtBP and CtIP as additional co-repressors to silence Notch target gene expression [48, 49]. The SHARP protein is very large (3664 amino acids in human) and contains four structural motifs, the RRM (RNA recognition motif) at the N-terminus and the SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal) domain at the C-terminus, the RID (receptor interacting domain) and the RBPJ interacting domain (RBP-ID) in the center (Fig. 2b). SHARP is also named SPEN after the D. melanogaster protein Split ends (Spen), which shares the RRM and SPOC domains, however, lacks the RID and RBP-ID of SHARP [50â<U+0080><U+0093>52]. Accordingly, both activating and repressive genetic interactions have been described between spen and members of the Notch pathway in the fly [53], but no direct physical protein interactions.                Regarding KyoT2, experimental data on Notch repression have been gathered in addition to structural analyses of the repressor complex [21, 24]. Evolutionary data, however, are lacking so far.                Taken all together, the knowledge on the negative regulation of Notch target genes is rather limited. It remains largely restricted to model systems, where Notch signaling has been studied experimentally, as well as to humans, where Notch regulation is of particular medical interest. And as outlined above, various mechanisms of regulation appear to exist in the animal kingdom used by some but not all clades. In the past years, sequence information for many more species has become available, allowing searches for possible repressor proteins outside of insects and vertebrates. Therefore, a search of the genome databases was performed, concentrating on the following questions: a) is there an evolutionary bond between the various repression mechanisms and b) are there homologues of the known repressors outside of arthropods or vertebrates?              ResultsRepression complex formation in arthropods                In contrast to the extremely high conservation of CSL proteins, the Hairless gene turned out to be evolving fast [9, 54]. Accordingly, evolutionary comparisons restricted Hairless orthologs to the class of Insecta for quite some time [42, 43]. Recently we identified Hairless orthologs outside of insects in two classes of crustacean, in Daphnia pulex (water flea, Branchiopoda) as well as in Litopenaeus vannamei (whiteleg shrimp, Malacostraca). Moreover, functional conservation of Daphnia pulex Hairless was confirmed experimentally in transgenic D. melanogaster [44]. Further searches identified Hairless orthologs in the crustacean Triops cancriformis (Tadpole shrimp) and potentially also in the centipede Strigamia maritima (European centipede). Triops is described as the oldest still living animal fossil (with about 300 million years of evolution), and T. cancriformis may be morphologically unchanged for the past 180 million years. Strigamia belongs to subphylum Myriapoda that separated around 500 million years ago from dipteran flies (Fig. 1d). However, Hairless orthologs are not present in all Arthropoda. For example, no significant sequence conservation to Hairless could be detected in Chelicerata (550 mio years) (Fig. 1d) [55] or more distant clades.              Hairless in Triops cancriformis and Strigamia maritima                The predicted Hairless ortholog of Triops cancriformis (TrcaH) (Fig. 3a) has two introns at positions also found in D. melanogaster Hairless (DmH). TrcaH encodes a highly basic protein (pI 10.3) of 593 amino acids (Additional file 1: Dataset 1) that shares the well defined functional domains, the NT and CT boxes of the SBD (Suppressor of Hairless binding domain), the GBD (Groucho binding domain) and CBD (CtBP binding domain). All the amino acids in the NT box demonstrated to be necessary for Su(H) binding in D. melanogaster, are 100% conserved [33] (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, they are at identical positions as the ones in D. melanogaster in the modeled structure (Swiss Model) (Fig. 3b). Moreover, three basic stretches can be identified, which may function as nuclear localization signals (Fig. 3a). A nuclear export signal predicted in Drosophila Hairless by NetNES 1.1 Server [45], however, has low scores, and an alignment to other NES sequences of D. melanogaster or D. pulex reflect poor conservation. The flanking series of basic amino acids may serve as NLS, thereby resembling the NLS/NES module of Hairless orthologs in other species (Fig. 3a).                                          Fig. 3                        Hairless orthologs from Triops and Strigamia. a Alignment of predicted Hairless orthologs from Triops cancriformis (TrcaH) and Strigamia maritima (StmaH) with the Daphnia pulex (DapuH) ortholog. Daphnia and Triops Hairless share the characterized functional domains, the Su(H) binding domain SBD which is subdivided into NT and CT box, the Groucho binding domain GBD, and the CtBP binding domain CBD. Only NT box and CBD are clearly discernable in Strigamia Hairless. The CT box and the GBD may be present with weak conservation only (dashed lines). Notably, residues known to contact the Su(H) CTD in D. melanogaster are identical in all the species (*). High confidence NLS and NES sequences are boxed, those of low confidence are dotted. Red arrowheads indicates an intron shared by all three genes. Black and blue arrowheads depict intron positions specific to Strigamia and Triops Hairless genes, respectively. Identical residues are marked in blue, highly conserved in red, conserved in yellow. b Structure predictions of the Notch repressor complexes from Triops and Strigamia, respectively, using SWISS Model and template PDB ID: 5E24 of the Drosophila complex. Left CSL CTD and right Hairless interacting domain. Potentially interacting residues are highlighted in yellow in Hairless, and green and orange in CSL                                      With Strigamia maritima, a first Myriapod genome sequence has become available. Deposited in flybase (www.flybase.org) five potential orthologous Hairless genes are predicted by OrthoDB for S. maritima. However, examination of the protein sequences reveals only for one of them (SMARO13018 with 478aa) similarities to the NT box of the D. melanogaster Hairless protein (Additional file 1: Dataset 1). Since neither GBD nor CBD are contained within the predicted SMARO13018 protein, the complete contig of the whole genome shotgun sequence was analyzed for further interacting motifs. Indeed, a well conserved CBD motif was found about 22â<U+0080><U+0089>kb downstream of the NT box (Additional file 2: Figure S1). If this sequence is in fact part of the Strigamia Hairless ortholog (StmaH), the StmaH gene must contain more than 20â<U+0080><U+0089>kb intron sequences (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Moreover, a stop codon shortly after the CBD coding sequence is extremely likely, albeit not present in the current database sequence, based on the high AT content of the flanking sequences typical for untranslated trailer sequences (Additional file 2: Figure S1).                In this case, the predicted StmaH protein has about 448 residues (Fig. 3a) (Additional file 1: Dataset 1). Since there are no other landmarks in the peptide sequence, this annotation is highly speculative. However, the StmaH protein has a well conserved NT box with 100% identical Su(H) interacting residues, it has a CBD and several basic regions that could serve as nuclear localization signals, and it is overall very basic typical of Hairless proteins with a pI of 10.25 (DmH, pI 10.4). A GBD might be present, however, shares little similarity to the GBD of other Hairless orthologs. A NES might exist based on the alignment with Daphnia Hairless, however, without a flanking NLS (Fig. 3a). The modeled structure predicts a repressor complex in Strigamia that convincingly matches that of the other arthropod species (Fig. 3b).                It was not possible to identify Hairless orthologs in genome sequences from spiders or lower arthropods (Fig. 1d). The rather weak conservation between Strigamia Hairless and Hairless proteins from Crustacea and Insecta may be taken as an indication that Hairless was firstly introduced about 550 million years ago after the Chelicerata-Myriapoda radiation (Fig. 1d).              Repression of Notch target genes in vertebrates                The evolution of SHARP/SPEN                  SHARP (or MINT) has been proposed to serve as functional homolog of Hairless in vertebrates for repressor complex assembly on Notch target genes [13]. SHARP belongs to the group of SPEN proteins characterized by a RRM and a SPOC domain (Fig. 2b). SPEN proteins come in two flavors, a very large form containing non-conserved internal sequences characterized by stretches of poly-amino acids (mainly Gln, His, Ser, Glu, Lys, Arg), and a tiny form named Spenito (Nito) in D. melanogaster (Fig. 2b) [52, 56]. DNA sequences potentially encoding SPEN protein homologues could be identified in all metazoan animals including sponges and Placozoa based on the good conservation of these two motifs, independently of whether using D. melanogaster Spen or Spenito or human SHARP as query. The sequences are conserved well enough that a tblastn search under almost standard conditions in NCBI database detects these domains even using whole genome shotgun sequences as template. If available, the mRNA sequences have been analyzed. However, in many cases the coding regions have been only predicted. For most species it was possible to define both, SPEN and NITO like homologues, suggesting that there is normally at least one of each present in the genome of higher animals.                  Vertebrate SPEN proteins differ from all the others, however, in that they contain two additional motifs not found elsewhere (Figs. 1d, 2b) [47, 57]. One, abbreviated RID, represents the nuclear hormone receptor interacting domain, the other is named RBPJ or CSL interacting domain (RBP-ID) and mediates SHARP/MINT binding to RBPJ to allow its function as direct repressor of Notch signaling activity [13]. D. melanogaster Spen, however, lacks a respective Su(H) binding domain and hence repression capacity.                  A screen for SHARP proteins with RBP-ID revealed that all vertebrates including the distant arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum) possess this domain (Fig. 4a-e). However, the RBP-ID is not found in the available sequences of the amphioxus (lancelet) genome, or in any other of the searched sequences outside of vertebrates (Fig. 1d). The RBP-ID shows remarkable conservation: approximately 50 residues are very well conserved up to the distantly related arctic lamprey, whereas the C-terminal sequences are more variable, and that of lamprey could be not aligned to the other orthologs (Fig. 4a). In C. elegans, two SPEN like proteins, named DIN-1S and DIN-1â<U+0080><U+0089>L, are formed by alternative splicing. The former contains an experimentally defined nuclear hormone receptor interacting domain, which however shares no sequence homology to the receptor interaction domain RID of vertebrates [58]. Both DIN-1 splice variants, however, lack homology to RBP-ID.                                              Fig. 4                          Comparison of SHARP/MINT proteins in vertebrates.

Human RBP-ID, shown to interact with CSL BTD and CSL CTD, is highly conserved in all vertebrates except the arctic lamprey, where it ends a bit short. Also C-terminally adjacent sequences except of lamprey (italic) are conserved, which becomes apparent in the comparison of the group specific alignments. The rattlesnake, however, is distinctly different from alligator and birds in this region.

A dotplot analysis of Drosophila Spen and human SHARP revealed many repetitive spots, reflecting the poly-amino acids stretches but not repeated sequence stretches (Fig. 5). Moreover, just two convincing alignments, the N-terminal RRM and the C-terminal SPOC domain, were uncovered. Neither the receptor interacting domain nor the RBPJ interacting domain of SHARP aligned convincingly to any sequence within Spen (Fig. 5). This leads to the conclusion that these motifs are specific to vertebrates, introduced into their genomes about 600 million years ago (Fig. 1d).                                              Fig. 5                          Dotplot analysis of Spen and SHARP. The dotplot analysis of Drosophila Spen and human SHARP shows typical repetition patterns that reflect the accumulation of single amino acids. A dotplot comparison Drosophila Spen with human SHARP reveals clear similarities only in the RRM and SPOC domains shown enlarged (red box, RRM and blue box, SPOC domain). The RID (orange) and RBP-ID (green) domains in SHARP are indicated as well                                        The evolution of KyoT2                  KyoT2 is a well characterized repressor of Notch signaling in mammals [21, 59, 60]. KyoT2 derives from a specific splice form of KyoT, a member of the Fhl1-family of proteins that contain four and a half LIM domains [21]. KyoT2, however, is characterized by just two and a half LIM domains followed by a short tetra-peptide motif (VWWP) that strongly binds to the BTD of RBPJ, called CID (C- terminal interaction domain) (Figs. 1b, c, 2c) [21, 24]. Based on structural analysis, the tetra-peptide motif contacts CSL similarly to the one of Notch RAM or of RITA (Fig. 1c) [21, 24, 25].                  LIM-domain containing proteins are present throughout the animal kingdom. KyoT2-like proteins that contain the CID, however, are restricted to placental mammals: here the tetra-peptide VWWP motif is 100% conserved (Fig. 6a). Already in marsupials this motif is changed [AWST in Opossum (Monodelphis domestica), VWSA in Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)] although located at an identical position according to sequence alignments (Fig. 6a, b). Whether marsupial KyoT2 proteins can bind their cognate CSL homologues remains to be determined, however it seems unlikely, as both miss the conserved proline residue at position four important for RAM-CSL contacts [61]. Outside of mammals, no KyoT2 homolog with a typical CID was identified so far (Fig. 6 a). The analyzed fish sequences (for example the zebrafish Danio rerio) contain a stop codon in its place. Computational translation of 3â<U+0080>² adjacent codons, however, reveals considerable conservation beyond the stop (Fig. 6 a). This may be taken as hint for an introduction of either the CID coding sequences or the stop codon in the recent evolution of KyoT genes.                                              Fig. 6                          Alignment of KyoT2 homologues from vertebrates. a Only placental mammals contain a KyoT2 protein with conserved CSL binding motif (Î¦WÎ¦P, cyan). Already in marsupial (koala P. cinereus and opossum M. domestica) or birds (eagle H. leudocephalus and tit P. major) the motif is changed, but an open reading frame still remains. In fish, a stop codon (*) occurs exactly within the motif, however, sequences C-terminally translate into many conserved residues (grey) compared to mammals. All proteins consist of two and a half LIM domains (red lines), each containing two tandemly repeated zinc fingers. Asterisks indicate zinc binding residues. Blue are identical, red are highly conserved and yellow are related residues. Note changes in marsupials. b Alignment of mouse KyoT2 with marsupial koala and opossum. Note high overall conservation.

Reptiles (brown box): Am: Alligator mississippiensis.                                          In search for a KyoT2 homolog in D. melanogaster, cDNA sequences were screened using tblastn. This returned Limpet (Lmpt), a protein containing six LIM domains as well as a PET domain (named for Prickle, Espinas and Testin, where this domain was originally defined) at the N-terminus (Fig. 7) [62, 63]. Apart from these extra domains, Lmpt and KyoT2 are remarkably similar in their LIM domains. What is even more compelling is the fact that both genes share introns at identical positions in the LIM domain coding sequences, a clear evidence of their phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 7, Fig. 10b). Similar to KyoT, Lmpt has several splice variants, but none contains a CID at a position corresponding to that in KyoT2. PET domain containing splice variants, however, feature a Î¦WÎ¦P tetra-peptide motif TWVP similar to the CID of KyoT2 (Fig. 7). Whether this Lmpt-motif can provide respective CSL interactivity, remains to be shown.                                              Fig. 7                          Drosophila Limpet is a homolog of human KyoT2. D. melanogaster Limpet protein harbors a PET domain, followed by six LIM domains. The alignment with human KyoT2 (also named Fhl1C) reveals surprising similarity between the LIM domains of KyoT2 (black labelling) and LIM domains two to four of Drosophila Limpet (isoform PN, red labelling). Intriguingly, three identical intron positions are present within this region (red arrows). Black arrows mark intron positions specific to Limpet. The CSL binding domain of KyoT2 (CID, italics) is not present in Limpet at a corresponding position. A similar tetra-peptide motif TWVP (italic green), however, is located at the N-terminus of the PET domain. Red residues are identical between the two proteins, blue are not conserved, black absent in one of the two species                                          Lmpt orthologs are specific to higher insects including the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) (Fig. 8). The prediction for the Tribolium Lmpt gene is preliminary though, and differs from that of the EnsemblMetazoa database. The Lmpt-motif is always found in the PET domain of Lmpt homologues from any insect species analyzed. Tribolium Lmpt, however, is more diverged (TFVP instead of TWVP) (Fig. 8). Less stringent alignment conditions uncovered sequences similar to Lmpt in distant species, primarily based on the conservation of the PET and the LIM domains. Even Hydra vulgaris encodes a similar protein called Prickle 3 like that shares the overall structure with Lmpt, i.e. six Lim domains and a N-terminal PET domain with a motif similar to the Lmpt-motif, LWVP (Fig. 9a). The alignment reveals that this motif is at identical protein position compared to the one in Lmpt. Moreover, two introns of the Hydra Prickle 3 like gene, located outside of the KyoT2 homology, are at identical positions to the ones in the D. melanogaster Lmpt splice variant used here (Fig. 9a,b, Fig. 10b).                                              Fig. 8                          Limpet orthologs in insects. Limpet orthologs are only found in higher insects. Highest conservation is seen in the LIM domains with many identical residues (blue), whereas the PET domain and the N-terminus are less well conserved. The tetra-peptide Lmpt-motif TWVP (italic, boxed) is present in all aligned sequences at identical position, with conservative variations seen in Tribolium castaneum (Tc) and Apis dorsata (Ad).

Best identity score in the LIM domain is between KyoT2 and Limpet (38.6%), followed by Limpet and Prickle 3 like (30.6%) and KyoT2 and Prickle 3 like (30.1%). Limpet and Prickle 3 like share considerable conservation over the entire length; the TWVP tetra-peptide motif is present at the identical position in the PET domain (italic green, boxed). Moreover, the two share conserved intron positions (red arrows and dashes). Green arrows indicate identical intron positions between Limpet and KyoT2. Black arrows and dashes mark intron positions specific to Hydra Prickle 3 like. Red residues are identical in all three proteins, green identical between Limpet and KyoT2, pink identical between Limpet and Prickle 3 like, and orange identical between KyoT2 and Prickle 3 like, blue are not conserved. b Scheme of the genomic organization of the D. melanogaster Limpet gene with representative transcripts (adapted from flybase). 15 transcripts are predicted, however, with 8 different open reading frames that fall into three classes: One encoding PET and LIM domain proteins (RB, RD and RN are shown as examples), one encoding LIM domain only proteins (RI, and RJ are shown as example), and the third containing neither (not shown). The exon encoding the PET domain with the TWVP tetra-peptide is indicated by the open arrow. The small downstream exons encode the LIM domain. Red arrows indicate exon/intron boundaries conserved between Limpet and Prickle 3 like, black arrows indicate exon/intron boundaries conserved between Limpet and KyoT2                                                                      Fig. 10                          Conservation of Prickle like proteins. a Alignment of human Prickle homolog 2 (HS pk; GenBank AAI19003.1), Drosophila melanogaster Prickle isoform A (Dm pk; flybase) and Hydra vulgaris Prickle 3 like (Hv pk3l). All three share the PET domain and the first three LIM domains. In this part many residues are identical (red), blue residues are not conserved. The Hydra protein has three additional LIM domains, whereas the human and fly Prickle proteins extend C-terminally with no further similarities or discerned motifs. Reduced stringency conditions were used to allow alignment of LIM domain three. Notably, a tetra-peptide motif TMVP with high similarity to the Lmpt motif is shared by all Prickle proteins at the corresponding position (italic green) in the PET domain. Blue arrows indicate intron positions identical in all genes, green identical in human and Drosophila and red identical between human and Hydra. Black arrows and dashes present species specific introns. b Schematic comparison of Prickle (pk), Prickle 3 like (pk3l) and Limpet (Lmpt) proteins from human (Hs), Drosophila (Dm) and Hydra (Hv). PET and LIM domains are color coded green and yellow, respectively. Intron positions are indicated by dashes: purple conserved in Limpet and prickle, blue conserved between KyoT2 and Drosophila Limpet and grey conserved in prickle. Only conserved intron positions are shown. Positions of defined CID motif in KyoT2 (VWWP) and potential interacting motifs (TWVP like) in the others are indicated                                          Low stringency database searches with either KyoT2 or Lmpt fetched homologues in all metazoan species including sponges and Placozoa, where they had been annotated as Prickle, Prickle like or Testin (Additional file 1 Dataset 1). Alignments of human and Drosophila Prickle with Hydra Prickle 3 like revealed a surprising similarity between the LIM domains of all these proteins (Fig. 10 a). Similar to Limpet but in contrast to KyoT2 they also share the PET domain with a presumptive Lmpt-motif plus additional LIM domains. Comparison of Prickle genes, including the ones from human, uncovered shared intron positions, reflecting common ancestry (Fig. 10 a, b). However, one must take into account that several splice variants for the three human Prickle genes are annotated. Moreover, Hydra Prickle 3 like clearly shares a stronger relationship with Drosophila Lmpt by the overall structure than with Drosophila or human Prickle (Fig. 10 b). The former contains six LIM domains, whereas Prickle homologues possess only three, and the third LIM domain does align just partly under standard condition. In fact, the C. elegans Prickle like protein contains only two LIM domains (GenBank: CCD62013.1 and CCD62014.1). Yet, conservation of intron position in the common alignment is striking: two are found conserved between all three homologues and three are conserved between two homologues, only two are specific to Hydra.                  Notably, Prickle like proteins, here characterized by the shared PET and two to six LIM domains, all bear sequences similar to the Lmpt-motif at identical position at beginning of the PET domain that may represent a CSL binding motif (Fig. 10 a). This study hence predicts a novel CSL interactor present throughout the animal kingdom, provided the functionality of Lmpt-motif is confirmed experimentally in the future.                DiscussionThe goal of this work was an in silico analysis of potential repressors of CSL mediated Notch activity throughout the evolution of higher animals. The majority of experimental work so far addressed Notch repression mechanisms in vertebrates and in insects [64]. These experiments revealed two different principles of repression: the assembly of a repressor complex on Notch target gene promoters on the one hand, and the competition for CSL binding between activating NICD and repressor molecules on the other hand. Whereas the former mechanism is found in both, arthropods and vertebrates, direct competition for BTD binding appears to be restricted to vertebrates only.Repressor complex formation                CSL itself is central to repressor complex formation by recruitment of specific co-repressors with high affinity. The best experimentally characterized co-repressor is the Hairless protein of Drosophila melanogaster, where manifold genetic and molecular data on its functions have been gathered over the decades. Recently, the structure of the repressor complex was solved. Drosophila Hairless protein binds to the fly CSL ortholog Su(H) with the same affinity as NICD. Binding occurs at the CTD of Su(H) at places different from NICD, however, the resultant distortion of the CTD structure excludes NICD binding [33, 37]. Hence, binding of NICD and Hairless to Su(H) are mutually exclusive, resulting in an indirect competition of the two proteins. Due to the extremely high conservation of CSL proteins, fly Hairless can form complexes with mouse RBPJ, and can repress Notch activity in cell culture assays [37]. Hence, a conservation of Notch repression mediated by a Hairless-type protein was expected in vertebrates as well. However, the present analysis does not support this idea.                Hairless is a fast evolving gene [9, 54], however, Hairless orthologs can be tracked in all insect species analyzed to date. Moreover, the Hairless gene from the water flea Daphnia pulex is still biologically active in Drosophila melanogaster, despite its divergence [44]. This in silico analysis found evidence for a Hairless ortholog outside of Pancrustacea, in the Myriapoda Strigamia maritima (Fig. 11 a, b), which however, is highly diverged. Overall this study suggests the introduction of Hairless as a CSL co-repressor about 500 million years ago after the Mandibulata-Chelicerata radiation in the evolution of Panarthropoda [55, 65], since no Hairless ortholog in more distant species was found (Fig. 11b).                                          Fig. 11                        Phylogeny of CSL transcription complexes. a Phylogenetic tree of the various animal clades from this study. Notch repressors Hairless, SHARP, and KyoT2 were not found outside the clade, where they have been originally identified. The Spen-like and Prickle-like family of proteins, however, is present in all the studied metazoan animals. b Phylogeny of Hairless evolution. Hairless can be traced back to Myriapoda that diverged from dipteran flies approximately 500 million years ago, i.e. after the Mandibulata-Chelicerata radiation. c Phylogeny of SHARP/MINT and KyoT2 evolution. SPEN-like proteins containing a RBPJ interacting domain (i.e. SHARP) are only found in vertebrates starting with arctic lampreys as example for Cyclostomata. Lampreys are considered living fossils that may not have changed morphologically the past 500 million years, but diverged about 600 million years back from mammals. The KyoT2 co-repressor, however, is only found in placental mammals. The CSL interacting motif in marsupial KyoT2 is quite diverged, presumably impeding the binding to CSL                                      SHARP (or MINT) similarly assembles a repressor complex with CSL plus co-repressors, and is thus considered a functional homolog of Hairless [13]. Repressor activity was demonstrated experimentally in cell culture as well as in vivo in Xenopus embryos [48] and in a floxed mouse strain [66]. SHARP binds the mammalian CSL ortholog RBPJ (or CBF1) both at the BTD and at the CTD [49]. SHARP-BTD contacts imply competition with the Notch RAM domain [47â<U+0080><U+0093>49]. SHARP can be therefore considered a dual repressor of Notch target genes by exerting both principal repression mechanisms, competition and repressor complex formation. SHARP belongs to the highly conserved group of SPEN proteins found throughout the animal kingdom that all share RRM and SPOC domains. The well-annotated genomes of fly, nematode and human contain each one copy of SPEN (respectively SHARP) and of NITO proteins [52]. However, the RBP-ID is specific to vertebrate SHARP proteins down to arctic lamprey (Fig. 11 c), and is extremely well conserved. The conservation extends beyond the determined interaction domain, suggesting additional as yet uncharacterized functions. The RBP-ID, however, is not found in lower chordates like Amphioxus (lancelets) (Additional file 1 Dataset 1), suggesting its introduction into a SPEN precursor about 600 million years ago during chordate evolution [67].              Competitors of Notch                Upon ligand-receptor contact Notch is cleaved at the membrane, and the intracellular domain NICD is released acting as a co-activator of CSL. NICD makes twofold CSL contacts, first with the RAM domain at the BTD, and second with the ANK repeats at the CTD [11â<U+0080><U+0093>14]. In C. elegans, RAM binding precedes and facilitates ANK contacts, whereas in Drosophila NICD-Su(H) contacts are stable in the absence of RAM [9, 11, 68]. Overall, the RAM domain of Notch is not well conserved. Notch proteins from man to worm share basic residues at the N-terminus of RAM, and a tetra-peptide Î¦WÎ¦P motif that binds a non-polar pocket of the BTD with high affinity [11â<U+0080><U+0093>14, 23]. In Hydra vulgaris Notch, however the Î¦WÎ¦P motif is altered to LWKF (Fig.1c). Mutation of the Proline residue to Alanine inhibits NICD binding by more than 300 fold [23]. Hence, the RAM-BTD interaction in Hydra is presumably very weak if not stabilized otherwise. Perhaps, the high affinity RAM-BTD interaction has been gained in the course of evolution in some clades, explaining the differential requirement in flies versus worm or mammals. Moreover, the high affinity binding may have started repressor evolution as further means of regulation.                The hydrophobic pocket of the BTD is targeted by a number of proteins that compete with NICD for the binding of CSL. These include the viral trans-activator EBNA2 as well as the repressors RITA and KyoT2. EBNA2 hijacks the Notch signaling pathway, stimulating cell proliferation by the activation of Notch target genes [22]. RITA not only competes with NICD, but also causes a cytoplasmic translocation and retention of RBPJ, thereby reducing its availability for activated Notch [26]. KyoT2 has been shown in reporter assays to compete with both, NICD and EBNA2 for the binding of RBPJ, thereby inhibiting transcription of Notch reporter genes [21]. The EBNA2 contact site was determined by mutational analyses of CSL [69, 70]. Detailed experimental and structural insights are available for RITA and KyoT2 binding of CSL, revealing striking similarities between the structures of the BTD-RAM and the BTD-repressor complexes [24, 25]. All these proteins share the Î¦WÎ¦P motif that contacts the BTD (Fig. 1 c) apart from further amino acids that specify the interaction [24, 25]. SHARP may make similar BTD contacts despite the lack of a typical Î¦WÎ¦P motif [49].                This work concentrated on the evolution of KyoT2, a specific splice form of KyoT, which harbors a CSL interacting domain (CID) specified by the Î¦WÎ¦P tetra-peptide motif. These analyses reveal the presence of KyoT2 homologues including CID only in placental mammals, and even not in marsupials, indicating the introduction of the CID roughly 100 million years ago. KyoT2 contains two and a half LIM domains that share highest homology with Drosophila Lmpt. The relationship of the two genes is strongly supported by conserved intron/exon boundaries. Lmpt shares good similarity with Hydra Prickle 3 like: both not only contain six LIM domains but also a PET domain. This classifies them as members of the Prickle protein family, which apart from PET generally contain 2â<U+0080><U+0093>3 LIM domains. PET is an acronym for the Drosophila proteins Prickle, Espinas and Testin, and respective homologues are present throughout the animal kingdom (see Additional file 1 Dataset 1). Interestingly, the well-conserved PET domain harbors a Î¦WÎ¦P motif at its N-terminus, which may have the potential to bind the BTD of CSL proteins. The human genome encodes three Prickle proteins in several splice variants, and two proteins more closely related to Drosophila Testin. All three human Prickle genes harbor a PET domain with the respective Î¦WÎ¦P tetra-peptide motif at the N-terminus. In Testin proteins in contrast, the first residue of the corresponding four amino acids is highly charged. Experimental evidence for respective interactions with CSL, however, is lacking. Drosophila Lmpt, for example, has been involved in the defense response to fungal and bacterial infections [62]. Moreover, downregulation of Lmpt activity resulted in an enhancement of phenotypes induced by a mutant form of the human androgen receptor in the fly. In these experiments, Drosophila was used as model organism to study candidate genes known from human to be involved in spinobulbar muscular atrophy [71]. Prickle function has been studied in greatest detail in D. melanogaster, as it is pivotal to planar cell polarity (PCP). Prickle belongs to the intracellular core PCP factors that stabilize PCP complexes and orient cells relative to Wnt/Wingless signals within a tissue, not only in Drosophila but also in man (reviewed in: [72â<U+0080><U+0093>74]). Despite the fact that interactions between Wingless and Notch signaling pathway are well documented (reviewed in: [75, 76]), a direct link between Notch activity and Prickle remains to be established. If it were confirmed, this work has uncovered a novel, very ancestral CSL interactor found in the entire animal kingdom including Protostomia and Deuterostomia.              ConclusionMechanisms of Notch repression appear to be specific to either chordates or higher arthropods. Orthologues of experimentally validated repressors were not found outside the phylogenetic group they have been originally identified. However, the data provide a hypothesis on the evolution of mammalian KyoT2 repressor from Prickle like ancestors. Moreover, the finding of a potential CSL interacting motif in Prickle homologues opens the possibility of a novel Notch repressor system present throughout the whole animal kingdom.Only in chordates and insects Notch repressors are experimentally characterized. Even in nematodes represented by C. elegans no repressors have been identified so far, despite the extremely well experimentally based study of the Notch signaling pathway. This study found an intriguing similarity of the LIM domain proteins murine KyoT2, Drosophila Limpet and Hydra Prickle 3 like, that all contain a novel, putative CSL interacting motif. Future work may establish Prickle like proteins as novel, very ancestral CSL interactors with an important role in Notch repression. However, only experimental studies can prove or disprove this hypothesis.Material and methodsDatabase searches                The following databases were used to identify genes in different species: basic local alignment search tool of NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html; http://metazoa.ensembl.org/index.html) and flybase (http://flybase.org) using tblastn as search tool for similar protein sequences. Alignments were done against nucleotide collections, whole genomic DNA, whole genome shotgun contigs, expressed sequence tags (est) and cDNA under standard conditions. If no similarity could be found, the search was redone under less stringent conditions.              Sequence analyses                Most analyses have been done with the embnet HUSAR database (https://genome.dkfz-heidelberg.de) using the following programs: restriction site and translation in all six frames, dotplot, multiple alignment (prrn), and several protein analyses programs. Unfortunately the data base closed service by December 2017, therefore, further analyses were done used ncbi services: conserved domain search (CD search), and COBALT for multiple alignments. Additional dotplot analyses was performed with EMBOSS explorer (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/dottup). Possible nuclear export signals were searched with the NetNES 1.1 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNES/) [45].              Gene annotations                Gene annotations were done manually. Therefore, the genomic sequence was translated in all three frames and then scanned for exon/intron boundaries (gt/ag rule), which maintain the open reading frame over introns. Afterwards the sequence was compared with sequences of prospective protein homologues and evaluated for improvements by sequence similarities.              Protein structure predictions                Protein structures of protein orthologs were predicted by alignment with known structures using SWISS Model (https://swissmodel.expasy.org) [77] and further analyzed by MacPyMOL.

Elymus tangutorum (Nevski) Hand.-Mazz, a cool-season hexaploid perennial, is an important pasture bunchgrass species used for forages and grassland restoration in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northwest China. In this study, 27 E. tangutorum accessions from diverse origins of western China were evaluated using AFLP markers in an effort to delve into the genetic relationships among them. The effects of eco-environmental factors and geographical isolation on the genetic diversity and population structure were also elucidated.                                Results                 On account of 554 polymorphic fragments amplified with 14 primer combinations, the mean values of some marker parameters including polymorphic information content, resolving power and marker index were 0.2504, 14.10 and 23.07, respectively, validating the high efficiency and reliability of the markers selected. Genetic dissimilarity index values among accessions ranged from 0.1024 to 0.7137 with a mean of 0.2773. STRUCTURE, UPGMA clustering and PCoA analyses showed that all accessions could be divided into the three main clusters; however, this results do not exactly coincide with geographic groups.

E. tangutorum differs morphologically from E. dahuricus Turcz. in the light of the short upward awns and its distribution in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), Xinjiang province of China and the Alpine regions of Central Asia. In QTP, E. tangutorum is widely used for the degraded grassland restoration, due to high productivity, drought resistance, cold tolerance, and adaptability [6]. As one of the more important forage grasses in QTP, E. tangutorum has been widely studied. Most of studies mainly focused on the domestication, cultivation, phylogenesis and genome constitution [4, 6].Understanding genetic diversity of wild plant germplasm and the relationships between ecogeographic and genetic characteristics may provide insights for better utilizing and conserving genetic resources [7]. Investigation of germplasm diversity can be implemented via morphological and molecular means. Previous analyses based on agro-morphological characters and geographical origin indicated that a wide range of phenotypic divergence occurred among Elymus accessions of ecotypes, and/or cultivars [8, 9]. DNA-based markers have been regarded as practical tools with high efficiency and wide genome coverage in illuminating the pattern of genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in plant germplasm resources, with various advantages over phenotypic traits such as being not subject to environmental influences, potential of unlimited numbers, and assay from any development stage. In Elymus species, diverse PCR-based markers, employed in diversity and phylogeny studies, such as RAPD [10], ISSR [11], SRAP [12], ScoT [9, 13], and AFLP [14â<U+0080><U+0093>16] have become prevalent as any prior sequence information is not required. Among different marker systems available at present, AFLP method could explore variation throughout the entire genome, including both coding and non-coding DNA regions and may therefore genome-wide variation was allowed. Moreover, AFLP offers high reproducibility and multilocus polymorphisms simultaneously identified using a single assay. These characteristics make the AFLPs extremely appropriate for molecular characterization of germplasm collection. Although previous work has provided preliminary data to characterize genetic diversity between and within two E. tangutorum populations from Tibet province of China by AFLP analyses [4, 5], until today there is no detailed study has been conducted for molecular characterization using a larger germplasm collection.Genetic diversity in natural plant populations is held especially by the spatio-temporal environmental heterogeneity, i.e., genetic differentiation is strongly influenced through isolation by distance or local adaptation [17â<U+0080><U+0093>19]. To estimate the impact of environmental factors on the genetic diversity is indispensable to gain a deeper insight into such evolutionary forces [20â<U+0080><U+0093>22]. Thus, the combination analysis of molecular markers and eco-geographical data can provide beneficial information for taking up suitable strategies for utilization and conservation of wild plant germplasms [19, 23, 24].Here, AFLP markers were used to analyze, on a regional scale, genetic diversity and structure of 27 wild E. tangutorum germplasm accessions indigenous from two contrasting climatic zones of Western China, namely Qinghai-Tibet plateau and Xinjiang province (Fig. 1). The goals of the current study were (1) to evaluate and compare the genetic diversity and population structure of E. tangutorum germplasm from different areas, and (2) to verify the potential influence of spatial and environmental factors on the patterns of detected population structure.                                      Fig. 1                      Geographical locations of the studied Elymus tangutorum accessions in western China                    MethodsPlant materials and DNA extraction                Twenty seeds of each accession of E. tangutorum were germinated in vermiculite under identical conditions (25â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C, 300 Î¼molsÂ·m2Â·sâ<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>1; 16-h photoperiod) in a plant growth chamber. Genomic DNA was extracted from bulked young leaves from five plants per accession employing a CTAB procedure [25]. The quality and quantity of extracted DNA was assayed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and NanoDropÂ® spectrophotometer and was diluted with sterile distilled water to give a final concentration of 100â<U+0080><U+0089>ng/Î¼L.              AFLP analysis                AFLP fingerprinting was carried out following Vos et al. (1995) with minor modifications [26, 27], but the primers were labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent dye at the 5â<U+0080><U+0099>end. Briefly, 300â<U+0080><U+0089>ng of total genomic DNA was digested using the two restrictive enzymes EcoRI and MseI, following ligation of proper adapters to the restricted DNA fragments. After ligation reactions, pre-selective amplification was performed with (EcoRI +â<U+0080><U+0089>1)/(MseI +â<U+0080><U+0089>1) primers. Then the products from the previous step were applied to selective amplification using (EcoRI +â<U+0080><U+0089>3)/(MseI +â<U+0080><U+0089>3) selective primers. Initially, 48 selective primer combinations were screened on six accessions, and 14 pairs were chosen based on total number of fragments detected, fragment robustness and polymorphism (Additional file 1: Table S1). The automated separation and detection were fulfilled on an ABI 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the assistance of GeneScan 500 ROX as internal size standard. Genemarker 2.2 (SoftGenetics) was used to score fragments of 60â<U+0080><U+0093>500â<U+0080><U+0089>bp with a peak height above or equal to 100 reflective fluorescent units (RFUs). Then AFLP data from all primers was transferred into a binary matrix, scored asâ<U+0080><U+009C>1â<U+0080> (presence of fragment) and â<U+0080><U+009C>0â<U+0080> (absence of fragment).              Data analysis                The discriminatory power of each AFLP primer combination was evaluated by calculating polymorphic information content (PIC), marker index (MI), and resolving power (RP) with polymorphic bands only. The formula to calculate PIC value of each primer combination is: PICiâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2 fi (1â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>fi), where PICi is the PIC of ith marker, fi stand for the frequency of the present fragments and 1â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>fi represent the frequency of absent fragments [28]. Marker index (MI) was calculated as MIâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>PIC Ã<U+0097> EMR, where EMR (effective multiple ratio) is defined as the product of the proportion of polymorphic loci (PP) and the number of polymorphic loci (NPF), namely the total number of polymorphic fragments per primer [29]. The resolving power (RP) of each primer was estimated as Rpâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0088><U+0091>Ib, where Ib (fragment informativeness) defined as Ibâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1â<U+0080><U+0093>2â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>|0.5â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>p|, where, p is the proportion of accessions in which the fragment is present [30].                To understand the genetic relationship among all 27 accessions, pair-wise genetic distance (GD) were calculated on the basis of the Diceâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coefficient by NTSYS-pc v2.10 software. To obtain a more detailed view of the distribution of genetic variation within and between different geographical groups (XJ vs QTP), mean GD among accessions belonging to the same and/or different groups was also calculated. Based on GD matrix, the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic (UPGMA) clustering analysis were performed. The robustness of the dendrograms was assessed with 1000 bootstrap iterations by Freetree software [31]. The Bayesian model-based clustering method was applied to explore the population structure within the studied accessions or genetically diverse population (or groups) using the STRUCTURE software v.2.3.4 (http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html). Following the suggestion by Forsberg et al. [32] for outcrossing species, the admixture model was adopted and the heterozygous loci were treated as missing data. Population structure analysis was performed on AFLP data of all 27 accessions without any prior classification based on the Bayesian model-based method. Evannoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ad hoc Î<U+0094>K statistic was used to determine the most probable clustering number of subgroups [33]. We set the number of clusters (K) from 1 to 5 (10 times for each K) for accurate assignments of accessions. For each run, the burn-in period of 50,000 iterations and a run length of 500,000 MCMC replications were implemented. Considering that the indication of the most likely number of groups, namely LnP(D) usually plateaus or increases slightly after the â<U+0080><U+009C>right Kâ<U+0080> is reached [25], we used Structure Harvester online software (http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/struct_harvest/) to detect optimum value of K based on Î<U+0094>K method [33]. The output files for the selected K based on ten independent runs were then processed in CLUMMP [34] using the LargeKGreedy algorithm and the Gâ<U+0080><U+0099>pairwise similarities. Results were exported to DISTRUCT [35] for better graphical presentation. We also executed spatial population analysis using TESS 2.3.1 [36], which has been described as carrying high percentage of correct inference than other Bayesian clustering algorithm under certain conditions [37]. Geographical coordinates of each accession were contained in AFLP dataset as prior information, and the MCMC algorithm was run under BYM admixture model with 50,000 sweeps and10 000 burn-in. Fifty independent iteration analyses were performed at each value of clusters K (2~5).The value of K with the highest likelihood was determined according to the deviance information criterion (DIC), and the results of runs with 20% lowest DIC values were processed using CLUMMP and DISTRUCT, respectively, as did in the STRUCTURE analysis. Tess outputs was further visualized in a geographical perspective using an R script (POPSutilities) written by Flora Jay [38].                To validate the genetic variation among and within inferred subgroups according to geographic origins or STRUCTURE results, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based on PhiPT (analogue of FST) value was using GenAlEx 6.5 was performed. The observed (Na) and effective number (Ne) of alleles, expected heterozygosity (HE), Shannonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s information index (I) [39], and Neiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s genetic distance among geographic groups were also calculated by GenAlEx.                Based on geographical location of each accession, the corresponding environmental data (precipitation and temperature parameters) was obtained by DIVA-GIS (version 5.2.0.2, http://swww.diva-gis.org/). The geographic and environmental distance matrix was calculated based on the Euclidean distance between pairs of collection sites using NTSYS-pc v2.10. Correlation between geographical and genetic distances (Nei-Li coefficients) between accessions was measured by Mantel test with 9999 permutations using IBD (Isolation by Distance) software v1.53 [40]. A similar analysis was conducted to compare the genetic distance and environmental distance (altitude, precipitation and temperature) for accessions in different geographic groups.              ResultsMarker informativeness                The AFLP fingerprinting was performed on 27 wild E. tangutorum accessions using 14 primer combinations. A total of 554 scorable fragments were detected with a mean of 40 per assay unit, of which 509 (91.7%) were polymorphic and 70 (12.6%) were unique (Tables 1 and 2). The size range of fragments scored across accessions was 60 to 500â<U+0080><U+0089>bp. The total number of amplified fragments (TNF) per primer pair varied from 30 to 47 and the number of polymorphic fragments per primer pair (NPF) ranged from 26 (E46M51, E-ATT/M-CCA) to 41 (E43M55, E-ATA/M-CGA). The number of unique fragments per primer pair (NFU) ranged from one (for E46M60) (NUFâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1) to 10 (for E40M59 and E50M72). The percentage polymorphism varied from 80.95 to 97.56% with an average of 91.77% per primer combination. This result suggests that E. tangutorum germplasm from western China could be characterized well by above AFLP dataset retaining abundant variation. Polymorphism information content (PIC) of each primer pair being 0.5 for AFLP as the dominant marker, 38% of polymorphic loci (195) possessed PIC values above 0.25, implying high discriminatory power of AFLP markers for E. tangutorum germplasm. In addition, the marker index (MI) and resolving power (RP) values for individual primer pair were recorded. There were positive correlations between PIC, RP and MI (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.98, 0.90 and 0.87, respectively). The most discriminatory primer combinations among 14 primers were E-ATG/M-CTC (E45M60, PICâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.3355, MIâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>32.73, RPâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>20.74) followed by E-AAC/M-GAC (E32M64, PICâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.3099, MIâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>29.32,

a clear peak of the Î<U+0094>K values when K was set at 2 (Fig. 2),which indicate that the sampled accessions belonged to two inferred genome fraction (Fig. 3). Samples with a inferred genome fraction value (membership proportion) of 0.8 or more to a subgroups are considered as pure, and less than 0.80, as admixture [32]. Considering individualâ<U+0080><U+0099>s membership proportion (Qi), all 27 accessions were assembled into three Bayesian subgroups designated as subgroup A (pure, blue fraction â<U+0089>¥0.8), subgroup B (admixture, 0.2â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¤â<U+0080><U+0089>blue fraction â<U+0089>¤0.8) and subgroup C (red fraction â<U+0089>¥0.2). The three subgroups included 10, 8 and 9 accessions, respectively. Geographically, most of accessions from Xingjiang (XJC) (10, 71.43%) belonged to subgroup A and the rest resided in subgroup B (Et20) and C (Et04 and Et13). Six accessions from Sichuan (SCC) were part of subgroup B and the five remaining accessions were part of subgroup C. For the three accessions from Gansu (GSC), Et18 consisted in subgroups B and the remaining two belonged to subgroup C.

This pattern is slightly different from the result from Structure runs in which the optimal Kâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>2. However, Considering the proportion of individualâ<U+0080><U+0099>s membership (Qi), the Bayesian subgroups based on TESS was almost exactly equivalent to the Structure result, both of which have the two dominant ancestry coefficients (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the geographic map displaying the Q matrix spatially by R script [38] also exhibited a general trend that the samples from XJC is obviously different from the samples from QTP, although the number of collection sites were limited and the spatial mapping for each accession is modeled over the whole Asia area rather than just considered at actual sampling sites (Additional file 3: Figure S2).              Cluster and principal coordinate analysis                Based on the 509 polymorphic fragments, estimates of the genetic distances (Diceâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coefficient) ranged from 0.1024 to 0.7137 with an average of 0.2773, implying a largely genetic divergence in the germplasm collections studied. Accessions Et08 and Et11 were most related due to a minimum genetic distance of 0.1024, while Et01 and Et23 were most divergent with the maximum genetic distance of 0.7137. The rest of accessions have exhibited different middle levels of genetic distances. Compared with 0.2611 of inter-group dissimilarity, the accessions from Xinjiang were more homogenous with lower dissimilarity values (0.2214), whereas the QTP accessions were more variable genetically with higher dissimilarity values (0.2785). These results were also confirmed by STRUCTURE analysis that most of Xinjiang accessions had pure type of genome fraction. The genetic distance matrix was used to build a hierarchical dendogram of genetic relationships based on the UPGMA clustering method (Fig. 3), in which three major clades were clearly categorized with further internal subgroupings. These three clades were identified at the 0.259 dissimilarity level. Grouping of most of accessions was congruent with their respective geographical origins. However, the accession Et20 and Et13 from Xinjiang did not separate clearly from QTP accessions. The bootstrap support of all major branches were higher than 50%, and a majority of them ranged from 70 to 99% revealing reliability of data and clustering results. Despite some differences, there was coherence between Bayesian method and hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. 3). The UPGMA dendrogram could separate well three Bayesian subgroups, except for the accessions Et27, Et19 and Et23 were revealed as outliers.                A similar clustering patter of the studied germplasm was demonstrated by the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (Fig. 4) illustrating that scatter-plot dipiction of PCoA is comparable to either of the hierarchical and Bayesian cluster analysis. That is, most of studied accessions were separated according to their geographical groups and/or the locations sites then put in the same cluster. PCoA was performed based on Nei-Li distances and confirmed division of 27 accessions into three major clusters: ClusterI, II and III. The first two principal coordinates represented the total of 69.1% of the total molecular variation (60.25, and 8.65%, respectively). The first axis (PC1), which contributed 60.25% of the variance, separated most of accessions, which have been assigned to three UPGMA clusters. The second axis (PC2),explained 8.65% of the variation, could further distinguish the accessions from cluster I and III.                                          Fig. 4                        Principal component analysis of 27 Elymus tangutorum accessions based on AFLP data                                    Genetic diversity estimates                Geographically, the region of Gansu and Sichuan Province are both part of the QTP region. Hence, we merged the GSC and the SCC group into a new group named QTP group. The total gene diversity across different ecogeographical regions was estimated based on 509 polymorphic fragments (Additional file 4: Table S2). The percentage of polymorphic loci (PP) was found to be higher in accessions of QTP (73.29%) than those of Xinjiang (70.76%). The Xinjiang group (XJC) showed high Neiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s indices of gene diversity (He) of 0.24 and Shannonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s diversity (I) of 0.36, whereas QTP group displayed a moderate levels of diversity (Heâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.21and Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.32). For the three Bayesian subgroups, the PP value was found to be highest among accessions from subgroup A (67.69%) followed by subgroup C (65.16%). The markers were least informative for assessment of genetic variability of accessions from subgroup B with PP restricted to 53.25%. Similarly, subgroup A showed the highest intra-group diversity (Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.36 and Heâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.24), whereas subgroup B had the lowest intra-group diversity (Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01 and Heâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.0.01).              AMOVA analysis                The two independent AMOVA analyses implemented relying on geographic origins and STRUCTURE clustering results and a highly significant variation (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) was detected (Table 3). For regional groups, 16.24% of the total variation was due to differences among populations and 73.90% variation was due to divergence within groups. Both of the pairwise FST values of two regional groups were significant (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¤â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) which were tested by GenAlex 6.5. The total FSTâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.162 indicated that the genetic variability is moderate between QTP and XJC groups. The three subgroups inferred from STRUCTURE showed 81 and 19% of total variance within and among the groups. This means that the total FST was 0.188 (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¤â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) and the derived three subgroups are highly structured by Bayesian inference panel. Significant differences in the FST were observed for all the pairwise comparisons of three subgroups inferred from STRUCTURE analysis (Table 4). The maximum pairwise FST (0.274) found between subgroup A and subgroup C was confirmed by their great difference of inferred genome fraction (Table 4). In addition, AMOVA analysis indicate that the level of gene flow either between geographic areas or between Bayesian clusters was low and insufficient to make homogenization in the E. tangutorum collections of western China.Table 3                        Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) among and within geographical groups and subgroups derived from STRUCTURE                      GroupsSource of variationd.f.Sum of squaresVariance componentsPercentage of variation (%)FstP-valueTwo Geographical Groups (XJC, QTP)Among groups1235.47612.63616.24%0.162â<U+0089>¤0.01Within groups251628.15465.12683.75%  Three Bayesian subgroups (A, B, C)Among groups2380.38214.32419%0.188â<U+0089>¤0.01Within groups241483.24761.80281%  Table 4                        Pairwise estimates of Fst values between Bayesian subgroups of E. tangutorum accessions as inferred by STRUCTURE software                       Subgroup ASubgroup BSubgroup CSubgroup Aâ<U+0080><U+0093>â<U+0080><U+0093>â<U+0080><U+0093>Subgroup B0.130*â<U+0080><U+0093>â<U+0080><U+0093>Subgroup C0.274**0.110**â<U+0080><U+0093>                      The P value for estimated Fst was calculated using 10,000 permutations (*Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05; **Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01)                                  Mantel test                To verify the eco-geographical factors influencing genetic structuring, Mantelâ<U+0080><U+0099>s test was used to estimate matrix correlations between genetic distance and geographical, elevation, average annual temperature, and average annual precipitation distances. A weak but significant pattern of isolation by geographic distance was detected within all accessions (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.312; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001). A similar result was found in each group except GSC (Table 5). This pattern derives largely from measurable differentiation among geographic groups seen in STRUCTURE and UPGMA clustering analysis. Furthermore, there was a faint or non-significant correlation between distance matrices of genetic and environmental factors for all accessions. However, a significantly positive correlation was demonstrated between genetic distance and the average annual precipitation distance in XJC (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.685; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) and Subgroup A (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.594; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05) (Table 5). In addition, relatively high Mantel r-value were observed between environmental factors and genetic distance for Gansu accessions, all of which were non-significant due to a small group size (only 3 accessions).Table 5                        Correlation between genetic distance and eco-environmental distance based on pairwise Mantel test for all accessions, geographical groups and Bayesian subgroups                      GroupsFactorsrpAllGeographical distance0.3120.001Elevation0.1180.13Average annual precipitation0.2850.01Average annual temperature0.1870.13XJCGeographical distance0.3130.076Elevationâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0520.4Average annual precipitation0.6850.01Average annual temperatureâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0510.36SCCGeographical distance0.1130.187Elevation0.30.09Average annual precipitationâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0050.69Average annual temperature0.4390.11GSCGeographical distance0.8090.32Elevation0.9710.24Average annual precipitation0.920.16Average annual temperature0.3090.49QTPGeographical distance0.1310.19Elevation0.3250.1Average annual precipitation0.050.32Average annual temperature0.3650.05Subgroup AGeographical distance0.3990.07Elevation0.2260.21Average annual precipitation0.5940.05Average annual temperature0.0140.51Subgroup BGeographical distanceâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.1250.5Elevationâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0640.41Average annual precipitation0.2080.24Average annual temperature0.0240.37Subgroup CGeographical distanceâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.0320.53Elevation0.0540.4Average annual precipitationâ<U+0088><U+0092>0.1860.31Average annual temperature0.0790.28                      XJC Xinjiang province of China (XJC), SCC Sichuan province of China, GSS Gansu province of China                                  DiscussionAFLP polymorphism and discriminating capacity of the assays                The practical availability of molecular markers in plant germplasm characterization depends on their power to discriminate the genotypically different accessions analyzed. In the present paper, the efficiency of AFLPs were assessed by recording different marker parameters concerning polymorphism, PIC (Polymorphic Information Content), MI (marker index) and RP (resolving power). In total, 509 AFLP polymorphic fragments with 91.77% of polymorphism were observed in the current work, which was obviously higher than previous works by AFLP in E. tangutorum and other related Elymus species. In the studies of E. dahuricus complex diversity, 69.35, 58.79, 29.65 and 27.14% of polymorphic fragments for E.excelsus, E.dahuricus, E.woroschilowii and E. tangutorum was obtained respectively [5]. In three Elymus species indigenous to East Asia, 34.2, 30.1 and 51.5% of polymorphism was detected for E. tsukushiensis, E. humidus and E. dahuricus respectively [14]. So far, the primer combinations used in this study successfully established high levels of genetic distinctness among the studied E. tangutorum accessions using AFLP fingerprints. The level of polymorphism obtained here with AFLP markers is also higher than that reported for other Elymus germplasm in western China by other types of dominant markers such as E. sibiricus by ScoT (89%) [13] and E. nutans by ISSR (91.4%) [41]. In all, the participation of polymorphic fragments largely relies on the species, origin ecogeographic area and the differentiation degree of sampled accessions, amount of primers and even type of molecular marker used [42, 43]. Moreover, as all primer combinations produced unique fragments (on average, 5 per primer), those primers could be used to differentiate particular accessions [44].                The polymorphic information content (PIC) values of 0.25 in current study demonstrated good marker discriminatory power in view of PIC value starting from 0 to 0.5 for dominant marker like AFLPs [45, 46]. This values also agree with AFLP studies done with other forage grass such as Dactylis glomerata [47] and Phalaris aquatica [48].The Marker index (MI) and resolving power (RP), two importantly alternative parameters in selecting informative markers for diversity studies [49, 50], had also displayed high efficiency of AFLP markers in unveiling polymorphisms in E. tangutorum germplasm. A very strong and positive correlation observed among PIC, RP and MI value in present work indicates the use of any of three parameters to screen the informative primer combinations [38]; although the relationship between the informativeness of molecular markers for identifying germplasms and these marker parameters is not totally clear [46]. Primer combinations E-ATG/M-CTC and E-AAC/M-GAC should be the most informative due to the highest records on PIC, RP and MI. Therefore, they are recommended for use in germplasm diversity analyses of other E. tangutorum collections. The Shannon index is an accurate alternative measure of diversity due to no need for estimate of allele frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The Shannon diversity detected in this study (0.34) was higher than those of E. sibiricus germplasm from western China by SCoT (Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.285) and EST-SSR (Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.237) markers [13, 51], also indicating a high level of genetic diversity in the accessions of E. tangutorum (Table 2).              Clustering pattern and genetic structure                It is attractive for breeders and germplasm curators to know the width of genetic diversity within a plant species of great importance [52]. The spatial genetic diversity analysis was conducted to verify the relationship between Elymus tangutorum accessions and biogeographical patterns by different clustering approaches. The UPGMA tree, the PCoA scatter plot, and the STRUCTURE analyses revealed a similar or identical membership among 27 wild E. tangutorum accessions, with a general grouping pattern including three genetically distinct and consistent groups. When these accessions are grouped according to clusters distinguished(Fig. 3), a greater range of Nei-Li distances is observed, which is comparable to previous studies for other Elymus germplasm with similar collection areas [13, 53, 54]. The first cluster derived from UPGMA tree consisted of ten accessions from Xinjiang Province in southwest of China, having a typical temperate continental climate. Meanwhile, Cluster I had the distinctly pure membership based on Bayesian clustering. The second cluster was primarily formed by accessions from southeast of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a region greatly far from Xinjiang, having a typical plateau mountain climate. Cluster II was corresponding well to the admixture subgroup STRUCTUE by analysis. The third cluster was also chiefly comprised by the accessions from southeast of QTP, with another distinctly pure membership. In short, the above results were in agreement with the geographical proximity of studied accessions and their genetic relationships.                Exceptions to this pattern of clustering were three accessions (Et04, Et13 and Et20) from Xinjiang,which were grouped with QTP accessions in Clade II and Clade III respectively. Since E. tangutorum is used in natural grassland restoration projects [6], it is possible that these three accessions are not native accessions from QTP and might have been introduced through domestic trade of seeds from Xinjiang. By contrasting the figures of UPGMA, PCoA and STRUCTURE analyses, two accessions (Et19 and Et27) assigned to Bayesian Subgroup II, fall into outgroups of UPGMA analyses. The possible reason causing such relationships may be STRUCTURE assumes that the loci within a population are under Hardyâ<U+0080><U+0093>Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and it is susceptible to many factors such as non-random mating, genetic drift, mutations, gene flow and selection [55]. Nonetheless, in different clustering analyses, it was largely found that separate clusters were often obtained in accordance with the respective geographic origin of accessions. Therefore the cluster pattern in present work might be due, in part, to differences in the adaptation of ecotypes to various selection forces from local conditions [56]. These results are in agreement with earlier studies which showed that geographical separation of other Elymus species germplasm did not always result in greater genetic differentiation [12, 57].                Indeed, the genetic diversity and population structure are determined by joint effects of many factors including geographic distribution, life cycle, mating system, selection and adaptation [58]. Considering the genetic differences among studied regions, the accessions from Xinjiang province showed higher diversity (Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.24, Heâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.36) than those from QTP (Iâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.21, Heâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.32). With regard to the Bayesian subgroups, higher diversity was found among accessions in subgroup A, which correspond to accessions from Xinjiang province. Based on a membership probability threshold of 0.80, most accessions (66.67%) such as subgroup A and C appeared to have a pure population ancestry in their genome component, which might result from limited gene flow among wild accessions with distantly geographical origin [59]. This explains why we have observed high diversity within geographical groups. However, more than half of the accessions from QTP were composed of admixture of genome fraction. Such case could be supported by the fact that E. tangutorum was frequently used to grassland restoration in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as mentioned above [6, 60]. Therefore, human activities may lead to frequently natural crossing by wind pollination between adjacent stands.                Results of AMOVA analysis showed low genetic variation among regions accounted for only 16.2% of the germplasm collection, whereas within-region variation accounts for 83.8% of the total variability. Similarly, only 19% of variation was detected for Bayesian groups,. These results on variation among accessions within geographical groups were confirmed with previous studies for E. nutans and E. sibiricus collections with similar origins [12, 57]. However, our results are more extreme. This could be a consequence of high gene flow resulting from grassland restoration project or the limited number of studied accessions for each region. The low among-group variance components indicated that the genetic background attributable to the geographical origin contributes slightly to the observed genetic diversity. Besides, the high gene flow and differentiation within E. tangutorum, supported by clustering and AMOVA, was also probably driven by its mating system, which is one of the important life-history feature that strongly influence genetic diversity and population structure [61]. As reported in genetic diversity study for Elymus dahuricus complex [5], E. tangutorum is probably a predominantly self-pollinated species with 0.9 of FST value. In their review, Hamrick and Godt [62] claimed that short-lived, self-pollinating species have most of their genetic diversity partitioned among populations rather than within populations. Similarly, Nybom [58] assumed that short-lived self-pollinating species allocate most of their genetic variability within populations. Each E. tangutorum accession in present investigation could be treated as a population consisting of seeds of neighboring individual plants collected from differently distant locations [63]. This situation may limit gene flow between accessions by geographic isolation barriers (i.e. mountains, rivers), thus the variation will maintain its characteristics within each accession. Although the within-accession variability is not determined by individual-based analysis, we have indeed observed the high degree of differentiation within this species according to UPGMA and PCoA analysis based on bulked DNA samples. Hence it is not surprising that the vast proportion of AFLP variation detected in E. tangutorum was present rather within than among groups, since the large-scale geographical group contained numerous accessions with distinctly genetic architecture. These results could be confirmed by that the totally average genetic distance (0.277) between all of accessions was higher than that (0.261) between accessions from the two main geographical groups (QTP and Xinjiang).              Correlation of genetic diversity and environmental variables                In virtue of the evolutionary forces, the decisive factor to influence the maintenance of genetic variability is the spatial variation of environment and the ecological difference between habitats [24]. Remarkably, the Mantel test between genetic distance and geographical distance in all E. tangutorum accessions and most groups was weakly correlated (Table 5) and similar results were reported in previous studies of Elymus species [2, 57]. Within accessions from QTP group, we found lower r-values of geographical distance (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.131) compared with the XJC group (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.313), which was not significantly different from zero and might be related to the highly heterogeneous topography nature of the QTP collection. The complex topographic features and climate will work together to form varieties niches to influence the genetic variability [64]. Thus, spatial distribution cannot be solely accounted for by a simple isolation-by-distance model and requires additional factors that influence the observed genetic population structure, such as environmental factors [24]. In the Mantel test between genetic distance and environmental distance, we found a significantly positive correlation between genetic distance and average annual precipitation (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.685; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01 and râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.594; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05) in the XJC group and Bayesian subgroup A. A possible explanation for this results is that in Xinjiang with arid and/or semi-arid temperate climate, the lower precipitation hinders seed germination and lead to decrease plantsâ<U+0080><U+0099> genetic diversity [17]. In the diversity study of E. nutans germplasm from western China, the environmental divergence like elevation is also related to genetic distance (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.695; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) [41]. On the other hand, the relationship between environmental factor and genetic distance is difficult to be fully resolved in complex environment [18]. This could be responsible for the weak and non-significant correlation between genetic distance and environmental distance found in QTP group. Besides, although the accessions of GSC group had high Mantel r-value (Table 5) between genetic distance and environmental distance except the average annual temperature (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.309), the correlation between the genetic diversity and environmental factor was still unraveled due to the small population size.              ConclusionsThis study indicates that AFLP markers are a powerful tool to measure genetic diversity in E. tangutorum and geographical and environmental factors (especially precipitation) together plays a crucial role in genetic differentiation patterns. These findings highlight the importance of local adaptation in shaping patterns of genetic structure inferred in E. tangutorum accessions fromWestern China. Therefore, collecting and assessing E. tangutorum germplasm from major geographic regions and special ecogeographic environment such as Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, will help to expand the genetic base and sample the full extent of available variation.NotesWen-Dan Wu and Wen-Hui Liu contributed equally to this work.Abbreviations                AFLP:                     Amplified fragment length polymorphism                  AMOVA:                     Analysis of molecular variance                  CTAB:                     Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium Bromid                  GD:                     Genetic distance                  I:                     Shannon information index                  ISSR:                     Inter-simple sequence repeat                  MI:                     Marker index                  NPF:                     Number of polymorphic loci                  PCR:                     Polymerase chain reaction                  PIC:                     Polymorphism information content                  PcoA:                     Principal coordinate analysis                  RAPD:                     Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA                  RP:                     Resolving power                  SCoT:                     Started codon targeted polymorphism                  SRAP:                     Sequenceâ<U+0080><U+0094>related amplified polymorphism                  SSR:                     Simple sequence repeat                  TNF:                     Total number of amplified fragments                  UPGMA:                     Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means                  DeclarationsAcknowledgeNot applicable.

KeywordsBladder cancerWeighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)Tumor stagingHub gene identificationBackgroundsBladder cancer was ranked fourth of the most common cancers in male, with an estimated 17, 240 deaths and 81, 190 new cases in 2018 cancer statistics [1]. The survival rate of bladder carcinoma sharply declined with the spreading of the tumor. The most common type of bladder cancer was transitional cell carcinoma, also called urothelial carcinoma. It was often diagnosed at an early stage, producing negative impacts on the patients daily life and wasting extensive social wealthy [2]. Currently, there were four types of standard treatment for bladder cancer including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy; surgery was the primary method in clinical trials [3]. Transurethral resection (TUR) with fulguration was suitable for treating superficial bladder cancer while radical cystectomy was often rendered for patients with bladder cancer at the advanced stage in the situation of which the organs near the bladder such as the prostate and the seminal vesicles of a male patient and the uterus, the ovaries, and part of the vagina of a female need to be removed [4]. Partial cystectomy can be offered to patients who have a low-grade tumor that has invaded the bladder wall but was limited to one area of the bladder [5â<U+0080><U+0093>7]. Biological therapy was an emerging revolution in the medical field, which involved the use of living organisms, substances derived from living organisms, or laboratory-produced versions of such substances to treat diseases. It can be used to treat cancer itself or the side effects of other cancer treatments [8]. Targeted cancer therapy was a type of biological therapy, which employs targeted-cancer-therapy drugs such as therapeutic antibodies to destroy cancer cells by interfering with a specific molecular target needed for cancer cell growth [9]. As such, it was important to find the critical genes which may be related to cancer growth and proliferation and thus can further affect the prognosis of patients. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples, and can be used for finding modules of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits, and then the correlation networks can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets [10]. It can be used to discover the genes for unknown function with biological processes, or for candidate disease or transcriptional regulatory work. Although it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t provide causality, the co-expression network can be used to identify regulatory genes underlying various phenotypes [11]. Multiple testing problems inherent in the microarray data analysis were resolved in WGCNA. Network approaches provided means to bridge the gap from individual genes to systems oncology [12]. It was not only suitable for mRNAs, but also for microRNAs and lncRNAs, for example, Giulietti, M et al. [13] have reported the expression of LINC00675 and LINC01133 lncRNAs associated with pancreatic cancerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s development and progression by co-expression network analysis. Zhou, X. G et al. [14] have found that hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-let-7c-5p, hsa-miR-218-5p, and hsa-miR-125b-2-3p were hub miRNAs related to prognosis as well as the pathological stage in colon cancer by the method. In fact, if the data met the requirements, WGCNA can be applied and certain information can be obtained. In our study, the WGCNA algorithm was employed to construct co-expression network, which was integrated with genetic information to explain the biological significance of the module genes, and then identified the hub genes of bladder cancer. Although it has been applied bladder cancer in several articles such as Li, S [15], Deng, S. P. [16], and Gaballah [17], and concluded by Giulietti, M [18], however, they choose to perform WGCNA only on DEG genes which may easily obtain the positive results, reduce the workload of calculation, and at the same time increase the possibility of leaving out the lowly expressed but highly correlated genes. In our research, all the possible genes were analyzed and our results would be more complete and reliable.Materials and methodsData collection                The gene chip GSE31684 [19] of bladder cancer with its clinical manifestation data was downloaded from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The platform was GPL570(Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0), and there were 93 bladder cancers samples with several clinical variables. A series of clinical traits are shown in Table 1. The raw data had been processed, and the gene expression matrix provided by the website was directly used for the analysis. More than 50,000 genes were entered into the BRB-arraytools (https://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools/) [20] for filtering: genes were excluded when less than 20% of expression data had at least a 1.6 -fold change in either direction from geneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s median value, and when the percent of data missing or filtered out exceeded 50%. The fold change value is not obtained by comparing the normal and tumor samples. It is a minimum fold-change filter, a parameter in BrB-arraytools, whose detail description can be found in the user manual in the website (https://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools/Documentation.html). Finally, a total of 13,222 genes passed the criteria. Compared to analyze the DEGs, our work requires a high equipment computer and carefully distinguish the false positive results, as mentioned above, its merit is obvious: the results would be more complete.Table 1                        The summary clinical information of the samples                      ItemsCounts valueGenderâ<U+0080><U+0083>Male68â<U+0080><U+0083>Female25Age at diagnosis69.13Â±10.15(years)Survival Months47.47Â±44.52(months)Stageâ<U+0080><U+0083>pTa5â<U+0080><U+0083>pT110â<U+0080><U+0083>pT217â<U+0080><U+0083>pT342â<U+0080><U+0083>pT419PLND Resultâ<U+0080><U+0083>Negative49â<U+0080><U+0083>Positive28â<U+0080><U+0083>None16Gradeâ<U+0080><U+0083>High87â<U+0080><U+0083>Low6Distant Lymphonodus Metastasisâ<U+0080><U+0083>none59â<U+0080><U+0083>yes34Local Recurrence After Surgeryâ<U+0080><U+0083>073â<U+0080><U+0083>120Metastasisâ<U+0080><U+0083>057â<U+0080><U+0083>136Smokingâ<U+0080><U+0083>Former56â<U+0080><U+0083>Never18â<U+0080><U+0083>Current19              WGCNA analysis of the filtered genes                The â<U+0080><U+009C>WGCNAâ<U+0080> R package was used to construct a co-expression network for the filtered genes [21]. After employing the â<U+0080><U+009C>hclustâ<U+0080> function to the expression matrix evaluated by the average method, gene chips including GSM786521, GSM786580, GSM786492, and GSM786537 whose cluster height surpass 150 were identified deviated and thus excluded from further analysis (As shown in Fig. 1a). The other 89 samples were used to calculate the Pearsonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Correlation Matrices. The matrix of weighted adjacency was created by formula amn = |cmn|Î² (amn: adjacency between gene m and gene n, cmn: Pearsonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s correlation, Î²:soft-power threshold). Afterward, the clinical trait data were loaded and the scale independence and mean connectivity were estimated. Additionally, the topological overlap measure(TOM) matrix, transformed by the adjacency matrix, was used to estimate its connectivity property in the network [22]. A hierarchical clustering dendrogram of the TOM matrix was constructed by the average distance with a minimum size threshold of 30 to classify the similar genes expression profiles into different gene modules. The different module eigengenes (MEs) and the clinical traits were then correlated. The gene significance (GS) quantifying associations of individual genes with the clinically interesting trait and the module membership (MM) which acted as the correlation between the module eigengenes and the gene expression profiles were calculated. As proved by previous research, if the GS and MM were highly correlated, the most important (central) elements in the modules were also tightly associated with the trait [23]. As such, they can be used to construct the network and identify the hub genes.                                          Fig. 1                        Sample dendrogram and soft-thresholding values estimation. a Sample dendrogram and trait heatmap. The cut height was set as 150 with four deviated samples of GSM786521, GSM786580, GSM786492 and GSM786537. The ten traits are respectively gender, age, stage, grade, local recurrence, metastasis, smoking, recurrence-free survival months, survival months and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND, positive means local metastasis) (b) Scale independence and mean connectivity of various soft-thresholding values (Î²)                                    Co-expression network construction and hub genes identification                The Cytoscape v3.6.0 was used to visualize the co-expression network in the module of interest [24]. At the same time, the network was analyzed by Molecular Complex Detection(MCODE) [25], a Cytoscape plugin that detected densely connected regions in networks that may represent molecular complexes. Algorithms for finding clusters, or locally dense regions, of a graph, were an ongoing research topic in computer science and were often based on network flow/minimum cut theory. The internal mechanism demonstrated that MCODE was suitable for co-expression network, where the proteins in the same complex often displayed high correlations and may be detected by the plugin. The parameters were set as follows. Degree cutoff: 2, node score cutoff: 0.2, cut style: haircut, k-core: 2, and max. Depth: 100. At the same time, WebGestalt was applied to find the transcriptional factors (TFs).              Function annotation of the module of interest and the hub genes                The gene ontology (GO) analysis results of the genes in the module of interest were also provided by WebGestalt [26]. As a biological network gene ontology tool for functional enrichment analysis in various biological contexts [27], Bingo was used to analyze the hub genes with the following criteria: significant level:0.05; statistic test: binomial; multiple testing corrections: Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction.              Survival analysis by TCGA data and results validation                UALCAN was a web portal for analyzing cancer transcriptome data [28]. It provided easy access to publicly available cancer transcriptome data and allowed users to identify biomarkers or to perform in silico validation of potential genes of interest. The overall survival of bladder cancer was conducted by UALCAN, and the expression levels of the hub gene in different stages were examined.              ResultsWCGNA analysis and modules significance calculation                The sample dendrogram and trait heatmap are shown in Fig. 1a. As mentioned above, the samples of GSM786521, GSM786580, GSM786492, and GSM786537 were excluded. The R package of â<U+0080><U+009C>WGCNAâ<U+0080> was used to classify 13,222 genes with similar expression levels into different modules. In our research, Î²â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>8 was set to guarantee high scale independence (near 0.9) and low mean connectivity (near 0). The dissimilarity of the modules was set as 0.2, and a total of 10 modules were generated (Fig. 2a). The module trait relationship is shown in Fig. 2b. The blue module associated with the tumor staging was the deepest(corâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.49, Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1E-06), which was chosen for further analysis(Fig. 2c). The module membership in the blue module and the gene significance have a high correlation(0.64) and high P-value(1.5E-105), suggesting that the module is suitable for identifying the hub genes associated with the staging of cancer. The eigengene adjacency heatmap is shown in Fig. 2d, which indicates that the blue module, the black module, and some other modules were adjacent.

Seventy-six nodes were identified after inputting them into Cytoscape (Fig. 3a). MCODE was applied to discover the hub clusters in the network. The most significant cluster was shown in Fig. 3b. Its degree, neighborhood connectivity, and other parameters were shown in Table 2. The identified hub genes were CDH11, COL3A1, COL6A3, COL5A1, AEBP1, COL1A2, NTM, COL11A1, THBS2, COL8A1, COL1A1, BGN, MMP2, PXDN, THY1, and TGFB1I1. In addition, we input the 76 genes into the WebGestalt with the P-value<â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01 and discovered four transcriptional factors including NFAT, SRF, FREAC3, and MEF2. Its network with the proteins was presented in Fig. 3c.

The genes with P-values less than 0.01 were COL5A1, COL8A1, and TGFB1I1(Fig. 5) while those with P-values between 0.05 and 0.01 were AEBP1, CDH11, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL11A1, MMP2, PXDN, BGN, and THY1(Fig. 5). 75% of the genes in the cluster suitable for prognosis prediction of the patients with bladder cancer (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05), suggested that the cluster was important for bladder cancer. The high expression of COL5A1, COL8A1, BGN, TGFB1I1, AEBP1, CDH11, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL11A1, MMP2, PXDN, and THY1 was related to the poor prognosis of the disease. As such, COL5A1, COL8A1 and TGFB1I1 can serve as the prognosis biomarkers for patients of bladder cancer. The boxplots demonstrating the correlations between the tumor staging and the hub genes were shown in Fig. 6. The significance of the gene expression in low and high stages was examined by the Wilcoxon test. Except for TGFB1I1, others were significant in distinguishing low and high stage of bladder cancers(Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05).

Lower-stage tumors were smaller and had a better chance of successful treatment whereas patients with higher-stage cancers may suffer a poor prognosis [29]. With the advancement of science and biological technology, the accuracy treatment of bladder cancer was gaining momentum, and its development called for the identification of the hub genes relating to bladder cancer. WGCNA was often used to relate modules to external clinical traits and identified the important genes of a tumor. Deng, S. P. et al. [16] had identified â<U+0080><U+009C>GDF9â<U+0080>, â<U+0080><U+009C>CYP1A2â<U+0080>, â<U+0080><U+009C>ATF7â<U+0080>, â<U+0080><U+009C>TRPM3â<U+0080>, â<U+0080><U+009C>CER1â<U+0080>, â<U+0080><U+009C>PTPRJâ<U+0080>, â<U+0080><U+009C>KCNIP1â<U+0080>, and â<U+0080><U+009C>LRRC15â<U+0080> as hub genes in bladder cancer by construction and estimation of two DCNs(normal and cancer state) in 2015. Gaballah [17] identified candidate genes: PURA, SRPK2, TRAK1, BRD2, and UPF3 in progression and invasiveness of bladder carcinoma based on DEGs acquired by comparing invasive and noninvasive samples by Limma R packages in 2016. Zhang, X. et al. [30] revealed POU2F3, NKD1, CYP2C8, LINC00189, GCC2and OR9Q1 were several remarkable â<U+0080><U+009C>hub genesâ<U+0080> in squamous cell carcinoma of urinary bladder in 2016. The samples were single cells from their own hospital, the DEGs were acquired by NOISeq R packages, and the WGCNA of bladder cancer were focused on intra-tumor heterogeneity measured by coefficient of variation (CV). Yuan, Lushun et al. [31] have reported that the overexpression of COL3A1 confers a poor prognosis in human bladder cancer in 2017.The DEGs used for WGCNA were obtained by comparing low stage bladder cancers (Ta-T1) and high stage bladder cancers (T2-T4) by Limma R packages, and hub genes were defined by module connectivity. Li, S. et al. [15] reported MMP11, COL5A2, CDC25B, TOP2A, CENPF, CDCA3, TK1, TPX2, CDCA8, AEBP1, and FOXM1 correlated with clinical prognosis of patients with bladder cancer in 2017. The gene chip GSE13507 they used contained 23 recurrent non-muscle invasive tumor tissues, 58 normal looking bladder mucosae surrounding cancer and 10 normal bladder. Probesets were filtered by their variance across all samples, and hub genes were identified using a networkScreening function. Giulietti, M et al. [18] have reviewed the literature of WGCNA analysis in bladder cancer and concluded hub miRNAs of miR-1-1/2, miR-28, miR-133a-1/2, miR-139, miR-143, miR-195, and miR-6507 in the disease by WGCNA in 2018. However, they choose to perform WGCNA only on DEG genes which may easily obtain the positive results and increase the possibility of leaving out the lowly expressed but highly correlated genes. In the current study, the gene chip GSE31674 including its clinical traits was downloaded from the GEO datasets. In order to avoid the disadvantages and make our results more accurate, all the filtered 13,222 genes were used for WGCNA analysis. We finally obtained 16 hub genes associated the staging of bladder cancer, including CDH11, COL3A1, COL6A3, COL5A1, AEBP1, COL1A2, NTM, COL11A1, THBS2, COL8A1, COL1A1, BGN, MMP2, PXDN, THY1, and TGFB1I1. These genes were associated with the process of collagen fibril organization(GO:0030199)(COL1A1,COL3A1,COL1A2,COL5A1,COL11A1),blood vessel development(GO:0001568)(COL1A1,COL3A1,COL1A2,COL5A1,MMP2,BGN,COL8A1,THY1),cell adhesion(GO:0007155)(COL3A1,COL5A1,COL11A1,TGFB1I1,CDH11,COL6A3,COL8A1,AEBP1,THY1,THBS2), extracellular matrix organization(GO:0030198)(COL1A1,COL3A1,COL1A2,COL5A1,COL11A1,PXDN), collagen biosynthetic process(GO:0032964)(COL1A1,COL3A1,COL5A1) in bladder cancer. They were also associated with the pathways of ECM-receptor interaction(hsa04512)(COL3A1, COL6A3, COL1A2, COL1A1, COL11A1, THBS2, COL5A1), protein digestion and absorption(hsa04974)(COL3A1, COL6A3, COL1A2, COL1A1, COL11A1, COL5A1),focal adhesion(hsa04510)(COL3A1, COL6A3, COL1A2, COL1A1, COL11A1, THBS2, COL5A1),and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway(hsa04151)(COL3A1, COL6A3, COL1A2, COL1A1, COL11A1, THBS2, COL5A1) in bladder cancer. The expression levels of most of these genes had positive correlations with tumor staging. After examination by the TCGA datasets, THY1, AEBP1, CDH11, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL11A1, MMP2, PXDN, BGN, COL5A1, COL8A1, and TGFB1I1 were associated with the patientâ<U+0080><U+0099>s prognosis(Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05). The P-values of COL5A1, COL8A1, and TGF B1I1 were less than 0.01 and were then thought important among them. However, TGFB1I1 was meaningless in revealing tumor stage and was excluded. COL5A1 [32â<U+0080><U+0093>35] encoded an alpha chain which was closely related to type XI collagen and was reported contributing to the metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma. COL8A1 [36â<U+0080><U+0093>38] was a short Î±-chains of type VIII collagen, which was connected to angiogenesis and vascular remodeling; it was reported playing an important role in hepatocarcinoma cells. In our study, we find it was also associated with bladder cancer.ConclusionAfter the weighted gene co-expression network analysis of bladder cancer and the examination of the hub genes, we find THY1, AEBP1, CDH11, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL11A1, MMP2, PXDN, BGN, COL5A1, COL8A1 associated with the tumor stage as well as tumor patientsâ<U+0080><U+0099> prognosis. COL5A1, COL8A1 were most significant in the prediction of the bladder cancerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s prognosis(P-value<â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01), and may serve as the therapeutic target for the disease.Abbreviations                BGN:                     matrix-remodelling associated 8                  BLCA:                     bladder carcinoma                  BP:                     biological process                  CC:                     cell component                  COL5A1:                     collagen type V alpha 1 chain                                      COL8A1                  :                     collagen type VIII alpha 1 chain                  DCNs:                     differential co-expression networks                  GS:                     gene significance                  MF:                     molecular function                  MM:                     module membership                  TGFB1I1:                     transforming growth factor beta 1 induced transcript 1                  TOM:                     topological overlap measure                  WGCNA:                     weighted correlation network analysis                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThanks for all the authors who provided the technical help for the analysis.

KeywordsLead poisoning3â<U+0080>² untranslated region (3â<U+0080>² UTR)SNPmiRNAAGTIntroductionLead is an important toxic agent that may be associated with population-level variations in cardiovascular disease rates [1]. Numerous population studies have shown that lead exposure can cause hypertension [2, 3]. However, the mechanisms involved in lead-induced hypertension remain to be clarified.The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure [4, 5]. Angiotensinogen (AGT), the initial substrate of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway, is involved in the development of hypertension in humans and other animals [6, 7]. Animal studies have also shown that acute and chronic lead exposure cause hypertension and cardiovascular disease by altering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme activity [2, 8, 9], inhibiting Na+-K+-ATPase [10], inducing oxidative stress, reducing nitric oxide bioavailability, [11, 12] and depleting antioxidant reserves [13]. Many studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms by which lead can influence vascular function. Although these mechanisms have been proposed to explain lead-induced hypertension, its etiology remains unclear.Polymorphisms in the AGT gene have significant effects on plasma AGT concentration, and are therefore involved in the pathogenesis of some diseases [6]. Su et al. [14] found that the rs7079 polymorphism was associated with blood pressure reduction in response to benazepril, while Ono et al. [15] showed that rs7079 might be a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Al-Najai et al. [16] identified rs7079 as an independent risk factor for various deleterious cardiovascular traits. rs7079 has even been recognized as a factor in body fat distribution [17].In addition, miRNAs often bind nucleotide sequences located in the 3â<U+0080>² Untranslated Region (UTR) of a given gene, modulating gene expression via post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms [18]. Because rs7079 is located on the 3â<U+0080><U+0099> UTR of the AGT gene, the AGT polymorphism might influence the binding of the miRNAs asiR-31 and miR-584 [19].As lead exposure can increase blood pressure and AGT gene expression [2, 9], and the rs7079 polymorphism may affect AGT gene function, [19] it is possible that rs7079 may play a role in lead poisoning. However, the relationship between lead exposure and rs7079 has not previously been studied. Here, we hypothesized that the rs7079 variant in the AGT gene would be associated with lead poisoning. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to determine whether rs7079 might be associated with lead exposure in case-control study. We also aimed to determine whether the rs7079 polymorphism would influence the binding of the AGT 3â<U+0080>² UTR by miRNA.Materials and methodsStudy population                Our population-based case-control study included 304 individuals who had undergone a physical examination between 2012 and 2013 in Wuxi, China. Each participant completed a standardized questionnaire and signed a consent form. We drew 5â<U+0080><U+0089>mL of blood from each participant, and used an atomic absorption spectrometer (AA800; Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to detect blood lead levels (BLLs). BLLs were determined based on the National Occupational Health Standards of P. R. China, GBZ37â<U+0080><U+0093>2002. Of the 304 participants, 114 individuals with blood lead levels (BLLs)â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¥â<U+0080><U+0089>400â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g/L were considered lead poisoned (case group), while 190 individuals with BLLs <â<U+0080><U+0089>200â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g/L were considered healthy (control group). The average lead concentration in production environment was 0.71â<U+0080><U+0089>Â±â<U+0080><U+0089>0.43â<U+0080><U+0089>mg/m3. Each individual in the case group reported at least 2 symptoms of lead toxicity, including headaches, nausea, gastritis, vomiting, lethargy, and poor appetite. Individuals who had smoked at least 1 cigarette per day for at least 1â<U+0080><U+0089>year were defined as smokers, and individuals who consumed 3 or more alcoholic drinks per week for at least 1â<U+0080><U+0089>year were considered drinkers [20]. All of our study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention.              Genotyping                We extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of all samples. Extracted DNA was dissolved in TE buffer. We genotyped the AGT gene using the TaqMan method on a Roche LC 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Shanghai, China). The primer and probe sequences used are available from the authors upon request. Negative controls were included on each plate to ensure the accuracy of the genotyping. Genotyping was performed blindly and independently by at least two different researchers. Approximately 10% of all samples were randomly selected for genotype confirmation; both sets of results were 100% concordant.              Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)                We used a human AGT ELISA kit (Cusabio, Wuhan, China), which employs a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay, to detect serum AGT levels in the case and control groups, following the manufacturerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s instructions. In brief, a microplate was pre-coated with an antibody specific to AGT. Standards and samples were pipetted into individual wells, such that all AGT was bound by the immobilized antibody. After removing any unbound substances, a biotin-conjugated antibody specific to AGT was added. After washing, we added avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase to the wells. Following another wash to remove any unbound avidin-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution was added to the wells, which developed color in proportion to the amount of AGT bound in the initial step. After color development stopped, we measured the intensity of the color.              Plasmid construction and luciferase reporter assays                To construct luciferase reporter plasmids for the AGT 3â<U+0080>² UTR, we first amplified 613â<U+0080><U+0089>bp fragments of the AGT 3â<U+0080>² UTR carrying the either the rs7079C or the rs7079A allele using PCR (forward primer: 5â<U+0080>²- TCTAGGCGATCGCTCGAGGGCCAGGGCCCCAGAACAC -3â<U+0080>² and reverse primer: 5â<U+0080>²- TATTGCGGCCAGCGGCCGCGGAGGCTTATTGTGGCAAGACG -3â<U+0080>²). For cloning purposes, the forward primer carried an Xho I restriction site at the 5â<U+0080>²-end, and the reverse primer carried a Not I restriction site at the 3â<U+0080>²-end. The amplified products were treated with the restriction enzymes Xho I and Not I. Finally, the amplified fragments carrying either the C or A allele were inserted into several cloning sites of the PDS131_psiCHECK-2 reporter plasmid. The plasmids containing C or A allele was conducted, respectively. These insertions were confirmed by sequencing.                We used functional luciferase assays to determine whether the miRNA mimics miR-31-5p and miR-584-5p affected AGT gene expression, and whether changes in AGT gene expression were influenced by the rs7079 polymorphism. For the luciferase reporter assay, HEK293 cells were placed in 24-well plates (8â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>104 cells per well). Half of the cells were co-transfected with PDS131_psiCHECK-2-7079C and psiCHECK-2, and half with PDS131_psiCHECK-2-7079A and psiCHECK-2 (both at a ratio of 50:1). The transfected cells were then re-transfected with miR-31-5p, miR-584-5p, or a non-targeting miRNA (negative control; GenePharma, Shanghai, China) at a final concentration of 20â<U+0080><U+0089>nmol/Î¼L.                To test the effect of lead on miRNA binding, transfected HEK293 cells were treated with 5â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼M lead acetate during the luciferase assay. We measured luciferase activity in HEK293 cell lysates 48â<U+0080><U+0089>h post transfection with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized against firefly luciferase. Each plasmid construct was evaluated independently in triplicate.              Statistical analyses                We used the Ï<U+0087>2 test to evaluate differences among the frequency distributions of selected demographic variables, drinking status, and smoking status. We also used the Ï<U+0087>2 test to compare the frequency distributions of each AGT allele and genotype between the case and control groups. We used multivariate logistic regressions to determine the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two-sided tests of statistical significance were conducted using SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).              ResultsDemographic characteristics of the study population                There were no significant differences between the case and control groups with respect to age, sex, drinking status, and smoking status (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>> 0.05 for all; Table 1). The mean age of the case individuals was 41.9 (Â± 7.4â<U+0080><U+0089>years; range: 22â<U+0080><U+0093>60), and the mean age of the control individuals was 40.7 (Â± 5.3â<U+0080><U+0089>years; range: 22â<U+0080><U+0093>62).

The frequencies of the rs7079 polymorphisms CC, CA, and AA were significantly different between the control and case groups (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.04 for all comparisons; Table 2). Moreover, a variant rs7079 genotype (CA or AA) appeared significantly more often in the case group (47.4%) than in the control group (33.3%; Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.02; Table 2). Thus, rs7079 variants CA and AA were associated with a significant risk of lead poisoning. Indeed, there was a significant association between individuals carrying either rs7079 CA or rs7079 AA and the risk of lead poisoning, relative to those carrying the rs7079 CC genotype (adjusted ORâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1.92, 95% CIâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1.16â<U+0080><U+0093>3.18).Table 2                        Angiotensinogen gene (AGT) re7079 allele frequencies in the lead-exposed and unexposed (control) population, and the association of these polymorphisms with lead exposure                      GenotypesBLL1a (nâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>190)BLL2b (nâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>114)                              P                              cCrude OR (95% CI)Adjusted OR (95% CI)dN%N%rs7079â<U+0080><U+0083>CC10052.67666.70.041.001.00â<U+0080><U+0083>CA8846.33631.61.86 (1.14â<U+0080><U+0093>3.03)2.27 (1.33â<U+0080><U+0093>3.86)â<U+0080><U+0083>AA21.121.70.76 (0.11â<U+0080><U+0093>5.52)0.93 (0.12â<U+0080><U+0093>7.31)â<U+0080><U+0083>CAâ<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>AA9047.43833.30.021.80 (1.11â<U+0080><U+0093>2.92)1.92 (1.16â<U+0080><U+0093>3.18)â<U+0080><U+0083>A Allele9224.29217.50.08                        The observed genotype frequency among the control subjects was in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p2â<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>2pqâ<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>q2â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1) (Ï<U+0087>2â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.954, Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>= 0.329 for rs7079                      a Blood lead level (BLL)â<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>200â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g/L                      b Blood lead level (BLL)â<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0089>¥â<U+0080><U+0089>400â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g/L                      c Two-sided Ï<U+0087>2 test for either genotype or allele frequency                      d Obtained from logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and smoking habits                                    Our ELISA indicated that individuals carrying the rs7079 CC genotype had higher AGT serum concentrations than those carrying the CA genotype (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01; Fig. 1), suggesting that rs7079 was associated with AGT expression.

The suppressive effect of miR-584-5p was greater than that of miR-31-5p. miRNA binding in the presence of the rs7079A allele was unaffected. This suggested that the rs7079A variant affected the binding of miRNAs to the 3â<U+0080>² UTR of the AGT gene, and might ultimately influence AGT transcription or translation.

DiscussionOur major novel findings were as follows: 1) the AGT polymorphism rs7079 C was significantly associated with an increased risk of lead poisoning in a population from China; 2) the risk of lead poisoning was significantly higher in individuals carrying the AGT allele rs7079 A (genotypes rs7079 CA and rs7079 AA); 3) the presence of the AGT rs7079 A allele disrupted the binding of miR-31-5p and miR-584-5p to the 3â<U+0080>² UTR of AGT, and increased AGT gene expression, which is likely to reduce lead poisoning risk.The epigenome may provide a suitable pathway by which lead exposure may influence disease susceptibility [21, 22]. Genetic analyses of polymorphisms in miRNA target regions have become increasingly common [23]. However, this is the first study to examine the association between SNPs in the miRNA target region of the AGT gene and lead poisoning. Our results increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which AGT is involved in lead poisoning.Lead exposure increases the risk of developing hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases [24]. AGT is an important regulator of blood pressure, and SNPs in the AGT gene are associated with increases in serum AGT levels and hypertension [6, 25â<U+0080><U+0093>28]. In a previous study, we found that lead exposure increased blood pressure by increasing serum AGT [29]. In this study, we found the blood pressure in cases was higher than controls, although it had not arrived the level of hypertension. It might own to the â<U+0080><U+009C>health worker effectâ<U+0080> [30]. We found no direct association between blood pressure and rs7079 variant, however, it might indicate the complexity of mechanisms of lead poisoning,Gene SNPs can be used to predict the toxicity of lead exposure [31, 32]. Here, rs7079 was significantly associated with the risk of lead poisoning, and individuals carrying the rs7079 A allele were at an increased risk of lead poisoning. Serum AGT concentrations were lower in individuals carrying the rs7079 C allele than in those carrying the rs7079 A allele, possibly because the rs7079 A allele decreases the binding between miRNAs and the AGT 3â<U+0080>² UTR. Therefore, our results suggested that rs7079 is a functional SNP, consistent with previous studies indicating that rs7079 was associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [15], body fat distribution [17], and coronary artery disease [16].Consistent with our results, a previous study used a luciferase reporter gene assay to show that the rs7079 A allele altered the binding of two miRNA mimics (miR-31-5p and miR-584-5p) to the 3â<U+0080>² UTR of AGT [19]. However, miRNA function was not directly affected by lead exposure.Our study had some specific limitations. First, sample sizes were small, particularly for the lead poisoning group, and more samples may serve to clarify our results. Second, due to the lack of samples, it was impossible to identify the association between the AGT SNP and miRNA binding in the lead-poisoned group. Third, AGT activity detection might be more convictive. Future work with larger sample sizes should focus on the function of rs7079 to clarify its specific involvement in lead poisoning.ConclusionsThis population-based case-control study indicated that the presence of the rs7079 A allele in 3â<U+0080>² UTR of the AGT gene significantly increased the risk of lead poisoning. The rs7079 C to A substitution weakened the binding between miR-31-5p/miR-584-5p and the 3â<U+0080>² UTR of AGT, possibly increasing AGT expression and, consequently, altering the risk of lead poisoning.NotesYu Wu and Miaomiao Wang contributed equally to this work.Abbreviations                3â<U+0080>² UTR:                     3â<U+0080>² untranslated region                  AGT:                     Angiotensinogen                  BLLs:                     Blood lead levels                  CI:                     Confidence interval                  ELISA:                     Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay                  OR:                     Odds ratio                  PCR:                     Polymerase chain reaction                  SNP:                     Single nucleotide polymorphism                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThis study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 81602833], Young medical key talents of Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning [grant number QNRC2016172] and Wuxi Strong Health Engineering Project [FZXK007].

IAV causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans that exacts severe economic losses globally. The virus uses strategies developed to exploit and subvert cellular proteins and pathways to increase its own replication and to inhibit antiviral immune response.                                Results                 A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (A/QH) was able to infect A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells, with a high infection rate for A549 cells. To identify host cellular responses of human cells to influenza infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AIV-infected groups and uninfected controls were identified using RNA-sequencing. The DEGs were annotated by Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, which revealed that the DEGs were mainly linked to cellular function and metabolic processes, while the cellular function that is probably associated with host cellular response of human cells, including defense response to virus and protein modification.

IAV causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans that exacts severe economic losses globally. The virus uses strategies developed to exploit and subvert cellular proteins and pathways to increase its own replication and to inhibit antiviral immune response.                              Results                A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (A/QH) was able to infect A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells, with a high infection rate for A549 cells. To identify host cellular responses of human cells to influenza infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AIV-infected groups and uninfected controls were identified using RNA-sequencing. The DEGs were annotated by Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, which revealed that the DEGs were mainly linked to cellular function and metabolic processes, while the cellular function that is probably associated with host cellular response of human cells, including defense response to virus and protein modification. All the DEGs and pathways were possibly involved in the response to IAV invasion.                              Conclusions                The global transcriptome analysis results revealed that sensitive genes and pathways of the cells were infected with the influenza virus and provided further evidence to investigate the complicated relationship between IAV and host cells.              KeywordsH5N1 influenza virusDifferentially expressed genesSignaling pathwayTranscriptomicBackgroundInfluenza is one of the commonest respiratory infectious diseases of humans. Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the influenza A genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. The threat of IAV to human health is significant and continual, which could be in the form of seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics [1]. It has been estimated that more than 50 million people globally have died from influenza [2]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has infected thousands of people and spread globally in transported poultry or via indirect contact [3, 4]. Currently, it is impossible to eliminate the virus during its infection [5].Host defenses against IAV infection are provoked by the innate immune system after virus attachment to target cells [6]. During infections of viruses, innate immune responses are triggered when viruses or their genetic material are detected by cellular pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system [7â<U+0080><U+0093>9]. Influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus could infect and induce excessive inflammatory immune responses which are associated with elevated morbidity as well as mortality [10, 11]. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the regulation of the balance between the protective and pathological immune responses under infection with various strains of influenza virus are still required to be elaborated.Transcriptomic analyses of the host cellular responses to viruses infection can be employed to investigate potential cellular factors that are related to viral infection either directly or indirectly [12]. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, a recently developed transcriptome profiling approach, combined with bioinformatics has become an important tool in the exploration of cellular signaling mechanisms. RNA-seq technology can be used to uncover dynamic alterations in the pathogen genome itself and systemic changes in host gene expression profiles during the process of infection by pathogens. Thus, RNA-seq technology could be useful in identifying the pathogenesis and mechanisms of the infection and interaction of pathogens. RNA-seq has been applied to study various viral infections and diseases, and previous studies primarily focused on the differing virulence of influenza virus strains [13, 14].In the current study, RNA-seq was employed to annotate host responses to infection with H5N1 influenza viruses in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T and A549 cells. The differential virus replication in A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells uncovered potential candidate gene that may be correlated with the observed resilience of human cells to highly pathogenic influenza virus infection. The global survey of virus type-specific and cell-specific mRNA profiles demonstrate the role and mechanism of host-virus cellular responses during influenza virus infection and demonstrate a signature response of the cells infected with the H5N1 influenza virus. We believe that this information will aid in the development of vaccines and other control strategies.MethodsVirus preparation                The highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus, A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (H5N1; A/QH), was stored at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The virus was grown in allantoic cavities of the 10-day-old, specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 72â<U+0080><U+0089>h. Virus titers in allantoic fluid were depended on calculating the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). Virus stocks were stored at â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>80â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C.              Cell cultures and antibodies                Human lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A549) and human embryonic kidney cells (293â<U+0080><U+0089>T) were obtained from the China Infrastructure of Cell Line Resources. The cell lines were grown in Dulbeccoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s modified Eagleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against nucleoprotein was obtained by immunizing the animals with hexahistidine-tagged nucleoprotein and matrix protein as described previously [15].              Virus infection and the RNA preparation                For virus infection, 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T or A549 cells were incubated with A/QH virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>h. The cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in DMEM for the indicated times in 5% CO2 at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C. The infected cells were collected, and RNA was extracted. The total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to RNA deep sequencing using standard Illumina protocols. The RNA quality was determined by analyzing ribosomal RNA band integrity.              RNA-seq analysis                For cDNA library preparation, the total RNA from the two cell lines was treated with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa Bio) following the instruction of manufacturerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and the quality was assessed using a model 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The RNA integrity number value of each sample was >â<U+0080><U+0089>8. The two viral cDNA libraries were prepared according to the standard Illumina protocol (NEBNextÂ® Ultraâ<U+0084>¢ II RNA Library Prep Kit for IlluminaÂ®). In brief, polyA-enriched mRNA was isolated with magnetic oligo (dT) beads from 2â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g of total RNA for each sample and fragmented using divalent cations at an elevated temperature. The truncated RNAs were subjected to reverse-transcription for the first strand cDNA with random primers (Invitrogen Inc.), which was followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. After the end repair and 3â<U+0080>²-adenylation, a single â<U+0080><U+0098>Aâ<U+0080><U+0099> base was added to the 3â<U+0080>² end of each cDNA fragment. This treatment was convenient for subsequent adapter-ligation with the pairâ<U+0080><U+0093>end adapters (Illumina). Following ligation, the cDNA fragments were purified by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and enriched by 15â<U+0080><U+0089>cycles of PCR to create the final cDNA libraries. The libraries were quantified using a DNA-1000 kit bioanalyzer (Agilent).              Transcriptome assembly                To annotate and value the transcript abundances for the sequenced reads, the human reference genome and annotation for protein-coding genes were downloaded from the website of the University of California at Santa Cruz (http://genome.ucsc.edu) as the reference. After filtering reads containing sequencing adapters and reads of low quality, the remaining reads were aligned to the human genome using Tophat v2.0.9. The distributions of reads for known genes were analyzed using the HTSeq.              Transcriptional profiling analysis                To analyze gene levels of 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T or A549 cells infected with A/QH virus, the Cuffdiff (v2.1.1) program was used to quantify the fragments per kilobase of gene model per million mapped reads (FPKM) to code genes in each cell. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used for differential gene expression analysis, and the FDR-corrected p-value <â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05 was considered DE genes.              GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis                Gene Ontology (GO) functional classifications were defined by the Blast2GO software, the enriched gene functional categories were further classified by the GO analysis, with p-value <â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05. Kyoto The Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database was accessed using the KOBAS software via a hypergeometric test, with a corrected p-value <â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05. Q-value is used as statistical method for estimating false discovery rate (FDR), which is a conventional significance measure in the analysis of genome-wide expression data, with a corrected Q-value <â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05.              Immunofluorescence assays                Cells grown in a 24 well culture plate were infected with A/QH at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The cells were collected at the indicated times and then fixed in 4% formalin buffer at 4â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C, followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBST) at room temperature for 10â<U+0080><U+0089>min. The slides were incubated in 0.4% bovine serum albumin at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>h, and then incubated with anti-NP antibody at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>h. After washing with PBST for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>h, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted in PBST at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>h, followed by washing with PBST for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>h. Cell nuclei were stained with 4â<U+0080>²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 20â<U+0080><U+0089>min and observed using a model LSCMFV500 confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (Olympus).              Host gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR                Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the transcriptase kit (Transgen) and subjected to quantitative PCR using SYBR Green PCR master mix (TOYOBO). The relative expression of mRNA was normalized by Î²-actin. The primers for eight target genes (Table 1) were designed by using Primer Premier 5.Table 1                        Primer sequences used for qPCR                      Gene NameForward Primer (5â<U+0080>²- 3â<U+0080>²)Reverse Primer (5â<U+0080>²- 3â<U+0080>²)RIN1GCACCTGGCGAGAGAAAAGTAGATTTCCGCACGAGGAACGTNF-Î±GGAGAAGGGTGACCGACTCATGCCCAGACTCGGCAAAGIFIT2AAGCACCTCAAAGGGCAAAACTCGGCCCATGTGATAGTAGACELOVL3CTGTTCCAGCCCTATAACTTCGGAATGAGGTTGCCCAATACTCCISG15CGCAGATCACCCAGAAGATCGTTCGTCGCATTTGTCCACCAIFIT1TTGATGACGATGAAATGCCTGACAGGTCACCAGACTCCTCACAKR1C3GTCATCCGTATTTCAACCGGAGCCACCCATCGTTTGTCTCGTTTXNGTGAAGCAGATCGAGAGCAAGCGTGGCTGAGAAGTCAACTACTA              Plaque assay                MDCK cells were seeded in 12-well plates and infected with serial dilutions of the virus in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 4â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g/mL of TPCK-trypsin for 2â<U+0080><U+0089>h, and then washed with PBS. The cells were covered with Modified Eagleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Medium containing 1% agarose (AMRESCO) and 2â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g/mL of TPCK-trypsin. The plates were allowed to solidify at 4â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 5â<U+0080><U+0089>min and incubated upside-down at 37â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C. After 72â<U+0080><U+0089>h, viral titers were determined through counting the visible plaques.              ResultsDifferential viral replication in human cells                By inoculating A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells with A/QH virus at a MOI of 0.01, the virus replication in human cells was determined. The ratio of infected cells was identified by measuring viral NP using immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. The results indicated that the virus titer of A549 cells was obviously higher than that of cells infected in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells (Fig. 1a). To confirm viral replication, A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells were inoculated with A/QH viruses, respectively, followed by the examination of their replication kinetics. Aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96â<U+0080><U+0089>h post-infection. A plaque assay was used to examine viral titers. A/QH virus replicated poorly in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells (Fig. 1b), with virus titers more than 1000-fold lower than the titers in A549 cells, indicating less efficient H5N1 viral replication in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. These results were further confirmed by the analysis of NP protein expression levels by Western blots; and, it was found that A/QH virus infecting A549 cells displayed higher NP expression, which is consistent with the staining analysis, (Fig. 1c).

The Western blot analysis was used to determine NP protein levels. Î²-actin is used as a control                                    RNA-seq analysis and reads mapping                We extracted total RNA, and built up sequencing libraries to perform deep sequencing. The Illumina-based RNA-seq was performed on the Hiseq4000 platform, and three sets (repeated 3 times for each group) of different cell samples were used. Three biological replicates were performed in each set. The sequence obtained by sequencing was used for subsequent analysis. Finally, the unique gene location or multiple genome locations could match total cell samples and control reads (Table 2).Table 2                        Summary of RNA-Seq data                      SampleRaw readsClean readsClean basesError rate (%)Q20 (%)Q30 (%)GC content (%)A549-8â<U+0080><U+0089>h29,385,75428,948,5784.12G0.0296.8989.6752.65A549-8â<U+0080><U+0089>h30,875,82629,048,5764.34G0.0295.4889.2152.10A549-8â<U+0080><U+0089>h28,045,73827,746,5884.31G0.0197.4691.7352.17A549-0â<U+0080><U+0089>h29,947,34428,298,4874.15G0.0297.2990.5052.47A549-0â<U+0080><U+0089>h29,678,85728,875,2434.35G0.0196.8789.8752.12A549-0â<U+0080><U+0089>h28,985,08527,856,3264.52G0.0196.8691.7852.32293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-8â<U+0080><U+0089>h27,094,85226,827,5903.97G0.0195.3888.8452.55293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-8â<U+0080><U+0089>h29,947,57627,948,5923.68â<U+0080><U+0089>g0.0296.4989.1752.71293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-8â<U+0080><U+0089>h26,048,57025,958,7963.86G0.0195.8289.8452.62293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-0â<U+0080><U+0089>h27,406,94526,396,8983.95G0.0195.4389.1452.48293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-0â<U+0080><U+0089>h29,094,04828,194,5123.72G0.0195.5089.6852.24293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-0â<U+0080><U+0089>h28,395,32926,998,3963.84G0.0296.9388.9852.61              Global changes in expression in response to host genes                RNA isolates were individually prepared from both H5N1 virus and mock infected A549 or 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. To identify their functions during viral infection, RNA deep sequencing was performed to analyze the total RNA profiles in uninfected or H5N1 infected A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. As shown in Fig. 2a, a total of 1299 promoted and 1422 suppressed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in A549 cells infected with A/QH virus. In contrast, 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells showed relatively few DEGs, with 144 promoted and 9 suppressed genes (Additional file 1: Table S1).                                          Fig. 2                        Identification and characterization of IAV infection. a A549 or 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells were infected with A/QH viruses at an MOI of 0.01 for 8â<U+0080><U+0089>h. Total RNA was extracted and used for RNA-seq analysis. The expression values shown in shades of yellow and green indicate gene level above and below the median expression value across all the samples (log scale 2, from â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>2 to +â<U+0080><U+0089>2), respectively. b The 20 highest fold-changes of the RPKM value of gene expression in A549-QH and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-QH was sorted (log scale 2, from A549-QH to 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T-QH). c qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of selected genes in A/QH virus-infected A549 or 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells relative to uninfected controls. The fold-difference was measured by the 2-â<U+0096>³â<U+0096>³Ct method; RNA levels were normalized to corresponding Î²-actin. Error bars represent standard deviation. d Venn diagram showing the distribution of shared differentially expressed genes in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T and A549 cells infected with A/QH virus                                      To compare gene expression profiles between A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells, we filtered out genes with low expression (FPKMâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001), calculated the fold-changes in RPKM value of each gene from the two samples, we used the statistical enriched and listed the top 20 fold-changes by the absolute value of log scale 2 obtained from both cell lines (Fig. 2b). The Venn diagram shown in Fig. 2c illustrates the overlap of A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells responding to A/QH virus infection induced DEGs, which may help to investigate the various influences induced by virus infection. Up-regulated genes in A529 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells included 2721 genes and 153 genes, respectively, with 79 genes common to both cell types. These results indicated a difference in human cells upon virus infection, with some shared alterations in expression among different cell types.              Confirmation of DEGs by quantitative RT-PCR                By performing quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on selected DEGs, the differential expression profiles of genes obtained by RNA-seq analysis were validated. Although minor differences were observed between these two types of analysis due to their intrinsic differences, the results of these two analyses demonstrated the same relative regulation of DEGs. Consistent with virus propagation over time, most of the DEGs displayed a higher level of mRNA in A549 cells than that in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells (Fig. 2d).                pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production induced by A/QH infections have been considered to be linked to elevated morbidity and mortality in humans. As shown in Fig. 2d, the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not changed in infected A549 or 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. However, the levels of AKR1C3, TXN, and the interferon response-related genes IFIT2, IFIT1, as well as ISG15 were markedly elevated in A/QH-infected A549 cells in comparison with infected 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. The expression of RIN1 and ELOVL3 in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells was higher than in A549 cells. These findings suggested a remarkable initiation of the response of the host gene in A/QH-infected A549 cells.              GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses based on DEGs                By importing datasets representing genes with changed expression profiles obtained from RNA-seq analyses for the analyses of GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, we examined possible biological interactions of DEGs and determined important functional networks by A/QH infection in human cells. The results of GO analysis of the five most common the subclasses of cellular processes are presented in Tables 3 and 4. The most common cellular process was biological regulation in infected A549 cells and chronic inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus in infected 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. The cellular process, which was in the biological process category, was most significantly regulated by A/QH infection.Table 3                        Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon A/QH virus infection in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T                      TopGO NO.P Valuelog (P Value)Numbers of DEGs1GO:0002439 (chronic inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus)0.051272.97064949322GO:0006547 (histidine metabolic process)0.25331.37318072223GO:0009075 (histidine family amino acid metabolic process)0.35321.0407208124GO:0002544 (chronic inflammatory response)0.469050.75704590625GO:0016337 (cell-cell adhesion)0.590230.5272429887Table 4                        Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon A/QH virus infection in A549                      TopGO NO.P Valuelog (P Value)Numbers of DEGs1GO:0065007 (biological regulation)5.16E-1942.1081810822GO:0034097 (response to cytokine stimulus)7.24E-1941.7695813GO:0002376 (immune system process)3.64E-1840.154552614GO:0050789 (regulation of biological process)8.15E-1839.348519945GO:0050896 (response to stimulus)1.76E-1738.57863885                Furthermore, DEGs were mapped into the KEGG pathway database to further explain the individual function analysis. Hundreds of signaling pathways was found to be enriched in cells, among which 32 pathways in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells and 60 pathways in A549 cells were found to be significantly altered (Q-value<â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05 and pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01). The top 20 enriched pathways in A/QH-infected A549 or 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells are summarized in Fig. 3. Metabolic pathways and purine metabolism signaling pathway are high associated with the responses to A/QH infection in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells (Fig. 3a). In A549 cells, many receptor-interaction signaling pathways were enriched, including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the Toll-like receptor-downstream pathway, and the Jak-STAT signaling cascade (Fig. 3b).                                          Fig. 3                        Top 15 enriched pathways based on DEGs in A/QH-infected cells. Pathway analysis allowed the construction of a scatter plot of KEGG pathway enrichment statistics for DEGs following A/QH infection of 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells (a) and A549 cells (b). Rich factor is the ratio of the number of differentially expressed genes noted in the pathway terms to all gene numbers noted in this pathway term. A greater Rich Factor indicates higher intensiveness. Q-value is the corrected p-value ranging from 0 to 1 (blue). A lower Q-value indicates higher intensiveness                                      GO analyses have also been employed to reveal the possible functions of the identified unique gene transcripts in cell samples. With the examinations of the differential unique genes in the A/QH group relative to cellular function and metabolic processes in A549 cells, we found that the most enriched biological processes mainly include the oxidation-reduction process, defensive response to viral invasion, and the signaling pathway mediated by type I interferon (Fig. 4), with alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity and dehydrogenase activity as the most significant molecular functions (Additional file 2: Table S2 and Additional file 3: Table S3).                                          Fig. 4                        GO functional enrichment of unique differentially expressed genes in A549 cells. GO enrichment of unique differential expression genes indicated that biological processes and molecular function were most enriched, judging by their p-values                                    DiscussionThe highly pathogenic avian IAV strain, H5N1, can cause severe disease and death, especially in older individuals in poor health with other underlying diseases [16]. Host barriers have hindered the efficient growth of influenza virus from one species in other species [17]. The receptor specificity of hemagglutinin and the internal genes of influenza virus are critical in host-range restriction. In addition to the virus itself, the host restriction protein has an irreplaceable role during virus replication [18, 19]. Airway epithelial cells are major target cells for H5N1 virus infection. Human A549 cells (wildly used cell lines as pulmonary epithelial cells) serving as virus-susceptible cells and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells (used as human kidney cells) serving as virus-insusceptible cells were used in the present study. H5N1 A/QH virus was used to infect A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. The virus is characterized to spread rapidly via migratory birds and is likely the major agents for several human infections throughout Europe and China in the past few years [20, 21]. Interestingly, virus propagation was higher in A549 cells than in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells. The reduced viral replication of virus in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells provided evidence to further reveal potential host factors and immunological pathways that are involved in the resistance against the infection of influenza virus, especially the H5N1 influenza virus.Previous studies have already extensively studied the influences of influenza virus proteins on immune escape. However, the exact mechanism underlying the regulation of the balance of host responses to virus infection has not been fully elucidated [22â<U+0080><U+0093>24]. The utilization of genome-wide profiling techniques (e.g., microarray analysis) has identified novel host factors involved in IAV infection [25]. Herein, transcriptome analysis using the RNA-seq technology was applied to identify DEGs of two host cell types during infection. Numerous genes displayed significantly altered expression levels and some common DEGs were revealed in the H5N1 virus-infected human cell lines. These results have discovered and verified a series of cellular targets that may be associated with the cellular responses to the infection of influenza virus.Previous study suggest that the transcriptional activity of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are regulated by the interferon-mediated immune response, which collectively play a significant role in innate antiviral defense [26]. The IFIT family of genes is a type of ISG, with important antiviral and immune regulation roles. We detected the up-regulation of interferon inducible proteins, including IFIT1, IFIT2, ISG15, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), which are coordinately expressed in A549 cells in response to H5N1 virus. The expression levels of these ISGs showed no significant differences in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells infected with H5N1 virus. ISGs can target almost any step in influenza virus life cycle [27, 28]. Some of the most potent antiviral effectors reinforce the system by further stimulation of ISGs, inducing a â<U+0080><U+009C>cytokine stormâ<U+0080> in these cells due to continuous secretion of cytokines [29]. Our results demonstrate that IAV infection can cause strong innate responses in human lung cell lines sensitive to IAV infection and reveal a series of ISGs that possess relationship with IAV infection. The attenuated induction of the interferon-mediated immune mediators may limit H5N1-induced virus propagation in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells.Metabolism, as a biological process, contribute to a series of chemical reactions that modify a specific molecule for storage. It has been shown that host cellular metabolic networks are changed by viral infections [30]. Our study demonstrate that metabolic pathways were prominent in the response of A549 cells, suggesting that some genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as AKR1C3 and TXN, play key regulatory roles. The regulatory function of the AKR1C3 gene in influenza virus infection remains to be further studied. A previous report indicated that AKR1C isoenzymes 2 and 3 may be related to the progression of hepatitis C virus-related liver disease in males. AKR1C gene expression has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of other malignancies via the regulation of metabolism [31, 32]. ELOVL3 is involved in metabolic regulation in humans [33]. The present data of pathways in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells demonstrated the significant enrichment of metabolic processes. Whether these regulations are related to the low replication capacity of the virus in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells will be our focus in future studies.A recent clinical study revealed a significant connection between early cytokine responses, immune cell recruitment, and inferior prognoses during H5N1 infection [34]. Extensive transcriptome studies have shown that cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammatory responses are common features of influenza virus lethality [35]. The present findings are consistent with the previous data. Reducing excessive host response appears to be a rational strategy of treating severe influenza, and drugs aimed to perform this strategy have made some progress in treating influenza. A deeper exploration of the transcriptome data of influenza virus will certainly help us discover more specific therapeutic targets or pathways leading to host overproduction of pathological transcriptional responses to influenza virus and then develop therapeutic drugs and strategies to combat lethal influenza infections.ConclusionOur results highlight a reliable approach to investigate the interactions of influenza virus with the host cells. The transcriptome analysis results demonstrated sensitive genes and pathways of two human cell types infected with H5N1 influenza virus. We believe that this data will inform the development of therapeutic drugs and strategies to lessen lethal influenza infections.Abbreviations                293â<U+0080><U+0089>T:                     human embryonic kidney 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells                  A549:                     human lung carcinoma epithelial cells                  DEGs:                     differentially expressed genes                  GO:                     Gene ontology                  IPA:                     Ingenuity pathway analysis                  KEGG:                     Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Ms. Xiaoshuang Zhang of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for viral infection, and Ms. Xi Liang and Ms. Weihua Zhuang of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for technical support.

The GO classification showed the Jerusalem artichoke unigenes were divided into three ontologies, with a total of 49 functional groups encompassing biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Among them, there were more unigenes involved in the functional groups for cellular processes, metabolic processes, and single-organism processes. 38,999 unigenes were annotated by KOG and divided into 25 categories according to their functions; the most common annotation being general function prediction. A total of 13,878 unigenes (22%) were annotated in the KEGG database, with the largest proportion corresponding to pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. A total of 12 unigenes were involved in the synthesis and degradation of fructan. Cluster analysis revealed the candidate 12 unigene proteins were dispersed in the 5 major families of proteins involved in fructan synthesis and degradation. The synergistic effect of INV gene is necessary during fructose synthesis and degradation in Jerusalem artichoke tuber development. The sequencing data from the transcriptome of this species can provide a reliable data basis for the identification and assessment of the expression of the members of the INV gene family.A simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci search was performed on the transcriptome data of Jerusalem artichoke, identifying 6635 eligible SSR loci with a large proportion of dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats, and the most different motifs were repeated 5 times and 6 times. Dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeat motifs were the most frequent, with AG/CT and ACC/GGT repeat motifs accounting for the highest proportion.                                Conclusions                 In this study, a database search of the transcriptome of the Jerusalem artichoke from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was conducted by high throughput sequencing technology to obtain important transcriptional and SSR loci information. This allowed characterization of the overall expression features of the Jerusalem artichoke transcriptome, identifying the key genes involved in metabolism in this species. In turn, this offers a foundation for further research on the regulatory mechanisms of fructan metabolism in Jerusalem artichoke.

Keywords                        Helianthus tuberosus L.TranscriptomeGene analysisSimple sequence repeatsBackgroundJerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) belongs to the genus Helianthus L. of Asteraceae. Although it is native to temperate zones in North America, it was introduced into China over 300â<U+0080><U+0089>years ago, where it has been planted sporadically as a pickled vegetable for a long time. The twenty-first Century has seen a gradual decrease of the economic value of Jerusalem artichoke, with a rapid expansion in its planting and processing. The Jerusalem artichoke tuber contains fructose, which can be used to process inulin [1], bioethanol [2] and various foods [3]. In addition, because of its strong stress resistance, it can be cultivated in dry and saline alkaline environments, and has also been utilized in the ecological treatment of desert soil [4], seashore saline soil [5] and heavy metal-contaminated soil [6]. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is one of the earliest areas in China to conduct large-scale planting and processing of Jerusalem artichoke. The climate is cold, with large differences in temperature between day and night. The yield of the Jerusalem artichoke tuber is high, due its elevated fructan content. Moreover, it has natural and pollution-free environmental advantages, being very beneficial to the processing of organic fructan products. The industry of Jerusalem artichoke planting and processing has achieved rich development potential in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.Fructose is the third largest storage carbohydrate after starch and sucrose. About 15% of angiosperms contain fructan, most prominently in the Compositae, Liliaceae and Gramineae families; which mostly grow in cold temperate zones [7]. Plant fructan has been studied for over 200â<U+0080><U+0089>years, with early research focused on the biochemical properties of fructans [8]. In recent years, abundant studies have shown fructan metabolism is closely related to plant resistance to cold [9], drought [10] and saline alkali [11], as well as other stressors. With the discovery of the enzymes involved in fructan metabolism, research focus has shifted to the understanding of the metabolic processes and functions of fructosan [12]. In addition to the important role of fructan in plants, processed food derived from this carbohydrate also helps maintain human health. The properties and processing techniques of fructan have been extensively studied [13]. Fructan is an optimal nutrient and sweetener for patients with diabetes and hypertension, as it has a caloric value of only 1â<U+0080><U+0089>kcal/g, and it is not easily digested and decomposed into monosaccharides and therefore does not sharply increase blood glucose [14, 15]. Highly polymerized fructans are often used as substitutes for fats in foods such as yogurt, ice cream and jelly pudding [16].Fructan structure is mainly linear or branched in plants and 5 different types of derivatives. The earliest model of fructan metabolism was proposed by research on Jerusalem artichoke [17]. Jerusalem artichoke is a typical crop that accumulates inulin-type linear fructan. This type is composed of D-fructose residues linked by Î²-2, 1 bonds with molecular weights ranging from 3 to 5â<U+0080><U+0089>kDa [18]. Current models of inulin-type fructan metabolism suggest its synthesis is based on sucrose as a substrate: First, the synthesis of kestose (1-Kestose) is catalyzed by sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST, EC 2.4.1.99), followed by elongation of the fructan chain [19, 20] catalyzed by fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (1-FFT, EC 2.4.1.100). Then, the degradation of fructan is catalyzed by 1-Fructan exohydrolase (1-FEH, EC 3.2.1.80), with the fructosyl being cleaved one by one from the end of the sugar chain. At present, the functions of known key enzymes in the metabolism of Jerusalem artichoke fructan are unclear, and which genes are involved in their metabolic regulation remains to be discovered.In recent years, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing has been widely used to study gene expression in different biological problems. This method can comprehensively and quickly acquire all mRNA sequences [21â<U+0080><U+0093>23] generated by gene expression in a certain state and identify important functional genes from it in order to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying different biological traits. In this study, the transcriptome of Jerusalem artichoke from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology with Illumina Hi Seq 2500 equipment. Functional annotation of genes, and functional classification and metabolic pathway analysis of unigene were carried out with bioinformatics methods to lay a foundation for further research on the key metabolic genes in Jerusalem artichoke, as well as for interpretation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of fructan metabolism, and the development of related molecular markers.ResultsAnalysis of RNA-Seq datasets                Illumina sequencing obtained a total of 123,169,632 reads, containing 18.68â<U+0080><U+0089>G of nucleotide sequence information. The percentages of Q20 (sequencing error rate less than 1%), Q30 (sequencing error rate less than 0.1%), and GC content were 98.28, 95.40, and 44.92%, respectively (Table 1). The data from the transcriptome sequencing had high volume and quality, providing good raw data for subsequent data assembly. Trinity was assembled to obtain 63,098 spliced transcript sequences, with an average length of 713â<U+0080><U+0089>nt and a N50 of 1106â<U+0080><U+0089>nt. The longest transcript in each gene was taken as an unigene, with an average length of 713.6â<U+0080><U+0089>bp. The length distribution of the unigenes revealed a total of 12,962 unigenes with a length greater than 1000â<U+0080><U+0089>nt, accounting for 20.55% of all unigenes. Among them, 34,765 unigenes had a length of 200â<U+0080><U+0093>499â<U+0080><U+0089>nt, accounting for 55.10% of the total; whereas 14,004 unigenes had a length of 500â<U+0080><U+0093>999â<U+0080><U+0089>nt, corresponding to 22.20% of the total; and 14,320 unigenes had a length of â<U+0089>¥1000â<U+0080><U+0089>nt, accounting for 22.70% of the total (Fig. 1). This indicated the transcriptome library had good sequencing and assembly results, and adequate for subsequent bioinformatics analysis.Table 1                        Transcriptome Sequence data quality for the Jerusalem artichoke                      Raw readsClean readsClean basesQ20(%)aQ30(%)bGC(%)124,500,360123,169,63218.68G98.28%95.40%44.92%                      aQ20: percentage is the proportion of nucleotides with a quality >â<U+0080><U+0089>20 in reads                      bQ30: percentage is the proportion of nucleotides with a quality >â<U+0080><U+0089>30 in reads                                                              Fig. 1                        Size range of unigenes from transcriptome data of Jerusalem artichoke                                    Functional annotation and classification                The assembled unigene sequences were separately aligned according to the Nr and Swissprot databases by Blast software. Results recognized 22,048 unigenes aligned to similar sequences in the Nr database, with E values ranging from 1E-50 to 1E-20, with a total of 9873 (44.78%). To determine the species to which homologous sequences belong, the sequence in which each unigene yielded the best results (the lowest E value) in the Nr library was selected (if there was a parallel, the first one was selected). The number of homologous sequences statistically aligned to each species was determined in the Nr database. The highest matches with the unigenes from Jerusalem artichoke were Cynara cardunculus (19002), followed by Daucus carota (1346), Helianthus annuus (1126), Vitis vinifera (1042), Theobroma cacao (934), Sesamum indicum (810), and others. 29,595 (46.91%) unigenes had similar sequences in the Swiss Prot database, where the E values of most ranged between 1E-50 to 1E-20, corresponding to 8135 unigenes (27.49%). Compared with Nr, SwissProt function annotation found a large reduction in unigenea with high similarity sequences, consistent with database characteristics. The SwissProt data source is very strict, and all sequence entries are carefully checked by experienced molecular biologists and protein chemists through computer tools and related literature. In contrast, the Nr database integration standard is looser, and any two sequences any differences are regarded as two distinct records.                The GO database was used to classify the unigenes according to biologic function. Results showed the 63,089 Jerusalem artichoke unigenes were divided into three ontologies (Fig. 2): Biological processes, Cellular components, and Molecular functions, with a total of 49 functional groups. Further analysis showed 46,360 GO entries belonged to 19 functional groups related to biological processes; 24,082 corresponded to 17 functional groups linked to cellular components; and 374,83 GO entries belonged to 13 functional groups related to molecular functions. Most unigenes were allocated to the functional groups of cellular processes (10,358 unigenes), metabolic processes (11,147 unigenes), the single-organism processes (8223 unigenes), the cell (8716 unigenes), cell parts (8716 unigenes), binding (10,443); while the lowest amount of unigenes were involved in the functional groups of cell killing (3 unigenes), locomotion (4 unigenes), metallochaperone activity (1 unigenes), translation regulator activity (1 unigenes), nucleoid (1 unigenes), extracellular matrix components (4 unigenes), extracellular region parts (5 unigenes) and the extracellular matrix (6 unigenes).                                          Fig. 2                        Gene ontology (GO) classification of assembled unigenes in Jerusalem artichoke                                      Jerusalem artichoke unigenes were compared with the KOG database and classified according to their function. 38,999 unigenes were divided into 25 categories, with the most annotated unigenes corresponding to General function prediction (7016 unigenes), followed by those related to posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones (4507 unigenes), and signal transduction mechanisms (4740 unigenes). Meanwhile, the groups with the least annotated unigenes were those relate to nuclear structure (147 unigenes), extracellular structures (114 unigenes), and cell motility (21 unigenes). The identified unigenes of Jerusalem artichoke were involved in most biological activities typical of growth and development (Fig. 3).

A total of 13,878 unigenes (22.00%) were annotated for analysis of metabolic pathways. Among the 7 most statistically significant pathways, carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways accounted for the largest proportion, followed by translation, global and overview, folding, sorting and degradation, amino acid metabolism, transport and catabolism, and energy metabolism. Most unigenes corresponded to metabolic pathways, indicating Jerusalem artichoke had strong metabolism during this period. On the other hand, more than 400 other unigenes were linked to other subclasses related to ribosomes, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways (Fig. 4).

G: Energy metabolism                                    Phylogenetic analysis of fructan synthesis and degradation unigenes                Results indicated 12 unigenes were involved in the synthesis and degradation of fructan (Table 2). The protein phylogenetic tree of Jerusalem artichoke and other fructan crops was constructed by MEGA 5.0 software. According to the topology of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5), fructan synthesis and degrading enzyme gene proteins were clustered and analyzed into three categories: nigenes, fructosyltransferase gene and fructosyl synthase gene, obtained by sequencing. The 12 candidate unigenesâ<U+0080><U+0099> proteins were dispersed in five major protein families of fructan synthesis and degradation enzymes; especially in the fructosyltransferase gene family, accounting for 91.67%. This may be because the fructosyltransferase gene is similar in structure to the vacuolar invertase and cell wall invertase genes, displaying the widest distribution in the phylogenetic tree. The fructosyltransferase gene were clustered with Unigene37416, Unigene49657, Unigene7092 and Unigene23036. These fructosyltransferase genes awere basically INV, CW-INV and Î²-fructofuranosidase. However, Unigene32177 was the only candidate unigene that was combined with the fructan synthase protein. In addition, Unigene37416 and Unigene49657 were on the same evolutionary branch as Helianthus annuus and Cichorium intybus, respectively. Unigene36264, Unigene46471, Unigene20477, and Unigene21582 were adjacent and on the same sub-branches, and Unigene11775, Unigene45359, and Unigene39046 shared the same distribution, suggesting they may have similar functions.Table 2                        Information of candidate 12 fructan pathways genes in the transcriptome of Jerusalem artichoke                      Gene IDLength(bp)Blast resultSpeciesE valueAnnotationUnigene00070921084                              Solanum tuberosum                            5.00E-162Apoplastic invertaseUnigene00117751982                              Solanum tuberosum                            2.00E-60Vacuolar invertaseUnigene0020477862                              Daucus carota                            1.00E-123Cell wall beta-fructosidase(Inv1)Unigene0021582445                              Rhus chinensis                            4.00E-62Beta-fructofuranosidaseUnigene0023036726                              Populus grandidentata                            9.00E-116Cell-wall invertaseUnigene00321772094                              Cichorium intybus                            3.00E-32Sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferaseUnigene00362641987                              Cichorium intybus                            1.00E-10Beta-fructofuranosidaseUnigene00374161838                              Helianthus annuus                            6.00E-36Cell wall invertase (Cw-inv1)Unigene00390462047                              Cynara cardunculus                            1.00E-126Cell wall beta-fructosidase(Inv2)Unigene00453592175                              Lycium barbarum                            2.00E-25Acid invertaseUnigene00464711841                              Cichorium intybus                            2.00E-11InvertaseUnigene00496571709                              Manihot esculenta                            4.00E-62Cell wall invertase                                          Fig. 5                        Phylogenetic analysis of 32 families of glycosyl hydrolase from Jerusalem artichoke and different species                                    Candidate genes involved in fructan metabolism and expression analysis of 12 candidate genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction                Assessment with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed in Jerusalem artichoke samples at the tuber formation stage to evaluate the expression of 12 unigenes related to the fructan metabolism. Changes in the expression of Cell wall-INV related Unigene23036 and Unigene39046 were similar Jerusalem artichoke had increased height and tubers had matured. The highest value was reached in the third stage and then gradually decreased, showing fluctuation (Fig. 6). The decomposition of sucrose is mainly catalyzed by INV in higher plants. INV is a key enzyme gene regulating sucrose degradation in Jerusalem artichoke, and can hydrolyze sucrose to glucose and fructose, which are the substrates for fructan synthesis. Interestingly, the INV-related Unigene36264, Unigene45359, Unigene20477, Unigene37416 and Unigene07092 were expressed at higher levels in the early stage of tuber development. With gradual tuber expansion, expression gradually decreased, with a slight drop after the initial second stage of tuber expansion, and remaining relatively stable in the late stage of tuber development. This difference in expression patterns indicates each type of INV may have different biological functions. In addition, Unigene21582, Unigene11775, Unigene49657 and Unigene32177 showed up-regulated expression throughout the whole development and expansion process of the Jerusalem artichoke tuber. The expression level continued to rise, especially from September 1st to the harvest season,. These unigenes may be associated with fructan accumulation in the late stage of tuber development of this species. The distinct expression characteristics of these INV-related unigenes indicate there is functional differentiation during the evolution process. In general, these unigenes are highly expressed in the tuber development stage; suggesting they may play an important role in the synthesis and degradation of fructan. However, further research is required to elucidate specific molecular mechanisms.

Among these unigenes containing SSR loci, 4521 (82.92%) contained 1 SSR locus, whereas the remaining 931 (17.08%) contained â<U+0089>¥2 SSR loci. Regarding distribution frequency, the ratio of dinucleotides and trinucleotides was relatively large, accounting for 45.24 and 42.53% of the total, respectively. Meanwhile, concerning the repetition of different primitives, the frequency of 4â<U+0080><U+0093>9 times repeats was higher, accounting for 95.31% of the total. Among them, they were mainly 5- and 6-time repeats, which corresponded to 1887 and 2059 unigenes, respectively, and accounted for 28.44 and 31.03% of the total (Table 3).Table 3                        Distribution of SSR types in the transcriptome of Helianthus tuberosus L                      Repeat numberMotif typeTotalRatio (%)Di-Tri-Tetra-Penta-Hexa-4003601351116069.13501736922732188728.44613017322222205931.037733247103299514.998456412235047.599256160012734.11>â<U+0080><U+0089>9256503023114.69Total300228224891691536635 Proportion%45.2442.537.372.552.31 100.00                We found the Jerusalem artichoke transcriptome to be rich in SSR types, with 6635 SSR loci containing 180 repeat motifs, corresponding to 4 dinucleotides, 10 trinucleotides, 30 tetranucleotides, 52 petanucleotides and 83 hexanucleotides. Among the dinucleotides, AG/CT repeat motifs were dominant, accounting for 32.9% of all SSR; while the repeating motifs ACC/GGT, ATC/ATG, and AAG/CTT in the trinucleotides accounted for 10, 8.4 and 8.4%, respectively. The higher proportion of tetranucleotides corresponded to AAAAC/GTTTT, AAAAG/CTTTT, AAAAT/ATTTT and AAACC/GGTTT, while the remaining tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide repeating motifs were more dispersed, with low occurrence frequencies, and account only for 9.4% (Fig. 7).                                          Fig. 7                        Proportions of SSR among the total tandem repeats in Jerusalem artichoke                                    DiscussionJerusalem artichoke is a hexaploid (2nâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>6xâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>102) outcrossing plant with a large genome [24], which utilizes tubers for asexual reproduction and has self-incompatibility, low hybridization rate, and a complex genetic structure. Compared with other large crops, bioinformatics resources on Jerusalem artichoke are relatively scarce. With the widespread use of transcriptome sequencing technology, mining for genetic resources is possible with low cost and high throughput. In this study, RNA-Seq technology was used to assemble and analyze the transcriptomes of different tissues at flowering stage, obtaining 63,089 unigenes. After analysis of the Nr and Swiss Prot protein databases in NCBI, 41,041 (65.05%) and 33,494 (53.09%) unigenes were not annotated as relevant information in each database, respectively. This phenomenon has been reported in the results of transcriptome sequencing in many species, such as Abelmoschu sesculentus [25], Fraxinus velutina [26], Morus alba L. [27], and other. This has been related to the short length of some Unigene fragments, the lack of information on the relevant database genes, and the possible presence of new genes in Jerusalem artichoke [28]. The GO database was used to analyze the functional classification and biological characteristics of the annotated genes. However, due to defects such as incomplete functional classification in the GO database, 41,738 unigenes have not been annotated to possible GO entries. Therefore, other bioinformatics methods are needed to supplement the functional classification of Jerusalem artichoke unigenes.Through the analysis of amino acid sequence alignment, we found the unigenes related to fructan metabolism in Jerusalem artichoke had some sequence-conserved functional domains, all belonging to the 32 family of glycosyl hydrolase (Glycosylhydrolysase 32, GH-32). The phylogenetic tree was constructed to show fructosyltransferases (FBE) and vacuolar invertase constituted a branch of the Jerusalem artichoke phylogenetic tree, while extracellular hydrolase and cell wall transformase were clustered into one species, indicating FBE in plants may have evolved from vacuolar invertase [29, 30]. These similar evolutionary origins are supported by studies where synthetase 1-FFT has been observed to display degradative enzymatic function, while the degrading enzyme 1-FEH sometimes has partial synthesis ability [31, 32]. Further research is need to clarify the functions of currently known fructan metabolism-related enzymes. Indeed, although some genes involved in fructan metabolism in Jerusalem artichoke fructan have been cloned [32, 33], other genes in this metabolic pathway need further exploration.Analysis of the expression of key unigenes in the synthesis and degradation of fructan in Jerusalem artichoke revealed 12 unigenes were expressed during tuber development. The metabolism of fructan is a complex processes. Fructan is a carbohydrate composed of multiple fructose groups linked by glycosidic bonds. Sucrose is a precursor of fructan synthesis, and different combinations of fructosyltransferases catalyze the synthesis of multiple types of fructans, without the involvement of phosphorylation or nucleotide cofactors [34]. Results indicate Unigene32177, which is related to fructan synthesis in Jerusalem artichoke, has similar expression patterns to sucrose invertases Unigene7092 and Unigene46471. Because the substrates are fructose and glucose produced by sucrose hydrolysis during inulin synthesis, fructan synthesis and sucrose conversion are thought to occur simultaneously. Current research on inulin-type fructan have focused on 1-SST, 1-FFT (two important genes involved in fructan synthesis) and FEH (which is ultimately responsible for the degradation of fructan). However, invertase INV is required for the complete degradation of fructan [35]. Because one the final product of FEH hydrolysis is sucrose, this reaction is inhibited by sucrose [36]. The outcomes of the present study indicate different INV have diverse expression levels in various stages of Jerusalem artichoke tuber development. It is hypothesized these functional differences among INV are expressed at a variety of stages, showing functional pleiotropy. More importantly, the synergistic effect of INV gene is necessary during fructose synthesis and degradation in Jerusalem artichoke tuber development. The sequencing data from the transcriptome of this species can provide a reliable data basis for the identification and assessment of the expression of the members of the INV gene family. Therefore, further study is required regarding the functional analysis of INV in fructose synthesis and degradation, and its involvement in signal transduction pathways.There is currently no SSR marker available in Jerusalem artichoke, and only 6 pairs of SSR-labeled primers have been identified in the same sunflower of Jerusalem artichoke [34], which does not meet research needs. However, the direct use of Jerusalem artichoke genome information to develop SSR markers is an important prerequisite for systematic research on the inheritance and evolution of this species. In this study, the transcriptome sequence information of Jerusalem artichoke was used to conduct a SSR locus search, identifying 6635 SSR loci with a frequency of 10.52%, which was higher than 7.6% reported for Cajanus cajan L. [35], but lower than the 14.70% documented for tea [36]. Dinucleotides (45.24%) and trinucleotides (42.53%) appeared most frequently as repeat motifs in Jerusalem artichoke, which was consistent with most species [37]. The most frequent dinucleotide repeat motif was AG/CT, echoing studies in dicots such as Hevea brasiliensis [38] and Vitis L. [39]. The most abundant trinucleotide repeat was ACC/GGT, which is inconsistent with the previous reports where the main repeat type of trinucleotide in dicots was AAG/CTT [40].ConclusionsIn this study, a database evaluation of the transcriptome of Jerusalem artichoke from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was conducted with high throughput sequencing technology to obtain a great amount of data on transcripts and SSR loci, depicting the general expression characteristics of this speciesâ<U+0080><U+0099> transcriptome, and identifying its key metabolism-related genes. Moreover, this study also provides a reference for subsequent investigation of the metabolism of fructan and its regulation in Jerusalem artichoke; along with abundant data for molecular biology research on Asteraceae Helianthus plants.Materials and methodsPlant material and RNA extraction                The transcriptome data was derived from the results of high-throughput sequencing conducted with Illumina equipment in â<U+0080><U+009C>Qingyu No. 1â<U+0080> Jerusalem artichoke in 2016. In March 2016, this variety was planted in the experimental site of the College of Agriculture and Forestry of Qinghai University (N36Â°43â<U+0080>²45.21â<U+0080>²â<U+0080>²E101Â°44â<U+0080>²57.69â<U+0080>²â<U+0080>²). After the roots (1â<U+0080><U+0089>cm of thick root tip, 1â<U+0080><U+0089>cm of young root tip), stems (1â<U+0080><U+0089>cm at the base of the stem, 0.5â<U+0080><U+0089>cm at the tip of the stem), leaves (0.1â<U+0080><U+0089>g of the first euphylla, 0.1â<U+0080><U+0089>g of the tender leaf), flowers (0.1â<U+0080><U+0089>g of flower petals, 0.1â<U+0080><U+0089>g of pollen) and tubers (0.1â<U+0080><U+0089>g of the longitudinal epidermis, 0.1â<U+0080><U+0089>g of the tuber center) were taken from samples in the flowering stage, RNA was extracted, and the mixed sample was formed in equal amount. Then poly (A) was added, and the sequencing linker was ligated to prepare a sequencing library for PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing.              Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly                The PE125 sequencing method was used to construct the Jerusalem artichoke transcriptome library using the Illumina HiSeqâ<U+0084>¢ 2500 sequencing platform. The original image data obtained by order were converted to raw reads via base recognition (base calling), and raw reads were filtered to get clean reads, followed by statistical analysis of the amount of raw data and its length. The original data was subjected to removal of sequencing joints, repeated redundant sequences, and low-quality sequence data. Then, the number of clean reads, their total length, Q20, Q30%, N%, and GC% were counted. Q20 represents the ratio of bases having a mass of not less than 20 after filtration, Q30 represents the ratio of bases having a mass of not less than 30 after filtration, and N represents the ratio of bases which were not determined after filtration. The assembly was performed using Trinity [41] software, the sequence was extended to contigs by overlap between sequences, and then transcripts were obtained by local assembly. Finally, Transcripts were homogenously clustered and spliced using TGICL [42] and Phrap software [43] to obtain a single gene cluster (unigene). Analytical projects included analysis of the sequencing assembly results, FPKM statistical analysis, and SSR analysis.              Sequence annotation                By comparing the protein database of Jerusalem artichoke to the protein databases (E value <1e-5) with the Blastx alignment tool, functional annotation was performed according to the similarity of the genes, and the protein with the highest sequence similarity with the given unigene was selected, thus the relevant functional annotation information. All annotation details were merged to summarize the information retrieved in this process. The protein databases utilized include Nr (Non-redundant protein database), Swiss Prot (Swiss Prot protein database), KOG (Clusters of orthologous groups for eukaryotic complete genomes), Cluster), GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). In addition, gene annotation was performed in the latter to identify key genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of fructan in Jerusalem artichoke.              Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat identification                Unigenes in the Jerusalem artichoke transcriptome data was investigated using microsatellite identification tool (MISA), Available online: http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa. The search criteria were: minimum repeat number of dinucleotide 6 times, trinucleotide 5 times, 4 nucleotides 4 times, 5 nucleotides 4 times, and hexanucleotide 4 times, and the SSR locus interval was set to a minimum of 100â<U+0080><U+0089>bp. The text file generated was imported into Excel for basic statistical analysis. SSR occurrence frequencyâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>number of searched SSR-containing unigene sequences / total number of unigene sequence; SSR distribution frequencyâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>SSR number / total number of unigene sequences; average distance of SSR distributionâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>total unigene length / number of searched SSR.              Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis                The test material was â<U+0080><U+009C>Qingyu No.1â<U+0080>, the main cultivar of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Planting occurred in the middle of April 2016 in the experimental field of the Academy of agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Qinghai University, Xining, Qinghai. The normal cultivation method was implemented, with a row spacing of 1â<U+0080><U+0089>m, and a plant spacing of 80â<U+0080><U+0089>cm. Samples were taken during the expansion of the tubers, and a total of 4 samples were taken, until the plants withered. The tuber was set to repeat 3 times. Immediately after sampling, it was placed in liquid nitrogen for quick freezing, and then stored at â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>80â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C in a refrigerator. RNA was extracted using the TIANGEN RNA prep Pure Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (DP432), and then gelled with 1.2% agarose gel, as well as freshly prepared 0.5*TBE for 15â<U+0080><U+0089>min with 150â<U+0080><U+0089>V to assess RNA integrity. In addition, the TaKaRa reverse transcription kit PrimeScriptâ<U+0084>¢ RTMaster Mix (Perfect Real Time) (RR036B) was used to realize reverse transcription according to manufacturerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s instructions. The RNA sample amount was 1â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼g, and the reaction system was 20â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼L. Furthermore, the reverse-transcribed cDNA sample was then stored at â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>20â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for later use. We performed real-time qPCR on a 96-well reaction plate with Applied Biosystems SteponePlus using TaKaRaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (TliRNaseH Plus) kit (RR420B). The internal reference primer was selected from the 25S ribosomal RNA primer F of Jerusalem artichoke: CTGTCTACTATCCAGCGAAACCA, R: AGGGCTCCCACTTATCCTACAC. The total volume of the quantitative PCR reaction was 20â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼L, containing 10â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼L of SYBR Premix, 0.6â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼L of the upstream and downstream primers, 3.4â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼L of ddH2O, and 5â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼L of 0.1* cDNA. The reaction conditions of qPCR were: Pre-denaturation at 95â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 30â<U+0080><U+0089>s; 95â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 5â<U+0080><U+0089>s, 60â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 30â<U+0080><U+0089>s, 40â<U+0080><U+0089>cycles. The fluorescence signal was collected during the extension phase at 60â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C to obtain the cyclic Ct threshold of different genes. At the end of the cycle, the dissolution curve was measured to evaluate the specificity of the PCR product. The dissolution curve program was 95â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 15â<U+0080><U+0089>s, 60â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 1â<U+0080><U+0089>min, and 95â<U+0080><U+0089>Â°C for 15â<U+0080><U+0089>s. Each sample contained 3 biological replicates during the quantification process, 3 replicates of the same sample, and 3 primer-free negative controls in each 96-well reaction plate. The relative expression results of the genes were calculated using 2-Î<U+0094>Î<U+0094>CT [44]. The HeatMap Tools at http://www.omicshare.com/tools/home/soft/heatmap/ were implemented to draw a heatmap with parameters set to: cluster_rows: TRUE, cluster_cols: TRUE, colors: green, black, red.
